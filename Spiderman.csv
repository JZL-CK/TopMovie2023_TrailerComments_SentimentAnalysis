@thomasle3418,2023-06-13T11:41:48Z,0,"This movie makes morbius' post credit scene much more sense. Sony's long term goal is to create the sinister six. 

Judging by this road map setting up the multiverse and introducing the concept of villians across different dimensions, I think Sony will be doing it differently with an added twist to the multiverse.  I think they are trying to pull off a multiverse Sinister Six battle with a multiverse group of spidermen, as their end game equivalent of MCU's avengers, End Game. 

They are creating their villain verse to, again, recreate this multiversal battle idea between spidermen and its villians across different dimensions, not only through animation wise, but also live action wise. And then, once that's done, they'll merge miles' dimension to the MCU's, as the comics suggest that  miles' dimension collapses and he joins earth 616. Idk if this is replicated in the MCU's earth, as it is a different earth, 19-9999. But, I think there's differently a merge of two different universes soon. That would be hard to do as MCU's timeline remains desperate to the spider-verse and MCU's timeline wants to remain separate to Sony's. Perhaps they will renegotiate in some fashion.

I think the device that Miguel created is able to go through both dimensions and time and so when Miles says send me back he means back in time to save his uncle. Also the talk of Uncle Ben could refer to how Peter could save Uncle Ben with the device. However Peter states without Uncle Ben they wouldn't become spiderman.

Lastly when Miguel states that he can choose to save 1 life(his uncles) or millions of lives, the millions of lives could link to how Fisk's creation was destroying multiple dimensions and therefore if Miles saves his uncle it could alter the future where they defeat Fisk.",True

- His mom talks with him as we see in the first scene
- Gwen travels to his dimension and catches up with him and recruits him (see the first look)
- Miles goes with her and is introduced, but he does something and an alarm is sounded, causing everyone to attack him
- Miles escapes through a multiversal traveling device of some kind, bringing him to Spider-Man India's dimension, but Miguel catches up with him and does the whole chokehold body slam thing (again, see the first look)",True

Like it is just so so relatable. He goes through the same troubles like every other human being on this planet, he has a few people who he loves and is loved by them. But what makes him a superhero is going out of his way to help someone, who he might not know. Probably that's what make a human a superhero in an ideal world - helping others even if you are complete strangers.

It meant that when this movie came around they had to rework Miles in simple ways that comic book fans had wished he'd been written back when he first appeared. The slightly bigger emphasis on his family dynamics and greater sense of self discovery in becoming Spider-man is a perfect bonus on top of the ingenious animation style, fantastic sound design and fun story.",True

20. I think wrestler spider-man or some random homeless 1:58
21.  Classic Iron spider, it may look more white than gold, but its just the filter or shade, since it also turned spider-man ps4's blue to black 1:58
22. Scarlet Spider Kaine (Swinging in front of screen) 1:58 
23. Last Stand Suit 1:59 (swinging in front of screen)

THIS is what Stan created Spiderman for - to be relatable and inspiring to the common world, to help us see the superhero within us by reflecting it.
This is what superheroes are for, and this is the Marvel we love since decades.
Whoever created this - you have my utmost heartfelt respect. First Wakanda Forever gave me this feeling and now Spider verse is here. I am loving every bit of it, so just THANK YOU!!

@janpaulschliemann9430,2022-12-14T22:55:06Z,1,Spiderman is usually the good guy but I'm sure how many Spiderman exist there are some bad Spiderman maybe different mind choice uncle Ben died and he didn't pull his punches like Andrew Garfield when Gwen Stacy died. Or this version where Dr octopus switched body with Spiderman and seen how strong he actually is I wish to see this scene in a movie or show. Or maybe even mind controlled Spiderman could also exist or a version where Spiderman is the new Dr strange.,True

It was funny seeing the new playstation Spiderman(Earth-1048), possibly walking with his Miles. The Spinneret of Earth-18119  (MaryJane being a spiderwoman as Peter's wife) and many other legit spidermen/women with actual series timelines behind them.

I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called ""I Miss The Old Kanye, "" man that would be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye",True

@jjstarrprod,2022-12-14T12:41:36Z,2,"DAMN ! This looks FIRE !
As someone working in the animation industry, I can tell ya : The first one was not only the best Spiderman movie ever, it also completely rocked the animation industry's boat, prior to Arcane ! With these 2 out there showing how it's done in CG animation, even Pixar and Dreamworks are starting to sweat a bit from their butt on their thrones, and had to try new visual styles like Turning Red and Bad Guys (and even Puss in Boots 3 trailer looks like it got some memo from Spiderverse ""choppy"" 12 frames per second and 2D vfx)

I was so ecstatic about Into the Spiderverse when it came out, I've been watching it 6 times in theaters, each time showing it to different batches of friends (who all fell in love with it !)

I'm SO ready for the second one !
And the 3rd one !

Not only the visuals look even more insane than the first one, but I'm feeling all the actors also gave it their all (so much looking forward to hear Hailee Steinfeld and Oscar Isaac's performances in there after Hawkeye and Moon Knight !)",True

@Smartskull0,2022-12-14T09:01:31Z,0,"Antinatalism is the ethical view that negatively values procreation and concludes that procreation is morally wrong under all circumstances. The justifications are: harm/suffering prevention, the questionable nature of gambling with another life, & the impossibility of consent to be born.

In summary:

1. There's no reason to create a child that‚Äôs for the child's sake. For the potential child, birth doesn't solve any problem that it doesn't first create.

2. Existence is imposed without consent. No one chooses to be born or chooses the circumstances of their birth.

3. Everyone experiences at least some suffering, and some people experience disproportionately more suffering than others.

4. Existence brings guaranteed harm for unneeded benefit‚Äîguaranteed harms being: pain, fear, worry, sickness, injury, grief/loss, fatigue, etc.

5. Bringing someone into existence means exposing them to all the harms of this world. It should go without saying that the presence of harm is bad.

6. The only way to guarantee that your kids won‚Äôt ever suffer is by never bringing them into this world in the first place, making the absence of harm good.

7. Even though there is good in this life, the unborn aren‚Äôt deprived of anything since they don‚Äôt exist to miss out on said good, therefore the absence of pleasure is neutral (neither good nor bad).

8. No one has the moral right to inflict serious, preventable harms upon others without their consent.

9. Intentional procreation is intentionally harming your loved ones, a questionable deed.

@BDLabs2,2022-12-14T07:09:53Z,0,"The Spider-Verse film series is my favorite Spider-Man series so far (even though the sequel hasn't been released yet), because the main protagonist has to develop his character arch while dealing with situations dealing with the multiverse. Once the comics revealed the existence of the multiverse, it never made sense to have super-heroes only deal with localized crimes. Especially with that same crime occurring across an infinite amount of times across the multiverse. I think what would really be a great addition to the Spider-Verse film series is Miles Morales also dealing with curing his villains along with the infinite Spider-Men (Spider-People?). Since the Peter Parkers in _No Way Home_ figured out how to cure villains, it only makes sense for Miles Morales to either learn from them, or figure it out himself to continue doing so.

The only time I will go and pay my money for a superhero movie of any kind, is if it's Spider-Man related, Venom related or Batman. No one else matters to me. Everyone else is boring and repetitive, so this is the exception I'm going to make when I see this movie.

Kind of cool how films of the Spider-Verse have a lot of human and heartfelt elements and can balance the crazy and wacky elements as well. Good to see Peter B. Parker as a father and Miguel and Jessica look great too. Not sure what the story is either, assumed it was about the Inheritors from the first teaser with Miguel fighting Miles protecting him while he's trying to save Gwen from an Inheritor but it seems different with everybody trying to fight him. Either way it looks amazing. ""And a few other choice adjectives Jameson uses."" Hope everybody has a great day.",True

Also, TOO MANY TOKENIZED SPIDER-PEOPLE!!! You Can See It's Gonna Be Worse Than the First Movie, And Will Be On The Same Level As All The Garbage Spider-Verse Comic Series. Also, Why Do We Need To See Peter Darker And Peter Girler Again? And Why Add Peter Cyberpunker (Tho, I Have A Love/Hate Relationship On 2099). Only Good Things About The Trailer However, Is Finally Letting Peter Have His Kid That Comics Are Not Doing Now, And (Sort Of) PS4 Spidey Cameo. But Still, No One Wants SJW Characters Like Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, Kamala Khan. Captain Marvel, Kate Bishop, Riri Williams, And Other Awful SJW Characters You're Putting.

I will now MEGA TROLL you for siding with John Sepulveda in purposely firing JB from the arcade tilt at the fashion square mall & for also being friends with the murderer James ""POS"" Albright ^_^. Vu, the main reason why you decided to get those chinese words tattoos on your back is because you have extremely low self esteem ^_^.
You got those tattoos just so that you can get girls to like you. Because you can never get girls just by talking to them the old fashion way. Because you have no game when it comes to women or life in general ^_^. 

You decided to pick up riding a motor bike for the exact same reason. = WOMEN :P. But it of course didn't get you anywhere now did it? ^_^. I have someone from the inside who's always ready to take your money every time you go to your late night poker club that your EX girlfriend Kim doesn't even know about ^_^ Best part is? You have absolutely no idea that your money is being stolen by me ^_^. Cause why do you think half of your money is always missing Vu? But then again, you're not that bright. You never were ^_^

And that banking account of JONIS PRIME aka the same un-unique account that both you & John also use for AIM as well, well guess what? That's also my property now too ^_^. You will be detained & get locked up in a cage for your sins Vu ^_^. Game Over for you I win ^_^",True

@an-qo6by,2022-12-13T19:36:01Z,0,"I have chills beyond. I think people can be amazing a lot of the time, but the media today has really made an effort to make sure we all think that most of the world is filled with evil and shit people. But then I see this and can imagine all the loads of people that had to find each other, come together, work together, understand the vision, and make something with their heart, sweat, and tears. All just to create something special and share it with the world, to bring some joy and to further this endless array of stories and beautiful art. 

I don't focus enough on the constant stories that are put out, at the end of the day, to help others escape into something and hopefully leave feeling some kind of impact. And there are people who genuinely are just rooting for you and your art, complimenting it, talking about it. It's all what makes me really enjoy and appreciate movies and television. This isn't just art it shows you how people can come together solely to just nerd out over things and I find that wholesome. Oh and of course,

 I really applaud every single person who worked so fucking hard on this. I think we're used to seeing so many well done shows and movies over the years, but still! It amazes me what we have in us. Isn't it crazy? It's not that deep but also I can make it that deep and yeah ahaha",True

@rahul_sanap,2022-12-13T19:27:38Z,2,"2:05  Wait, wait, wait... Something tells me that all 3 of the main spider-men (well, Peter Parker, Miles Morales, and Spider Gwen) are being deceived by Spider-man 2099, and all the spider-men of other universes that have gone a dark path are all gathered there, and then Gwen is like ""How is it possible for Spider-men to have gone down a bad path? We are supposed to be the good guys!"" and then it's Mile Vs Spider-man 2099, and Peter & Gwen Vs all the other Spider-men.

Pls don't read this if you don't want to, I haven't watched the movie so it isn't a spoiler, but you might be like ""OMG! He's right!"", but I think how these movies go, someone's gonna die... My first guess is Spider-Gwen (Which I ruled out after a few minutes, because then noone would be there to protect Spider-Gwen's universe, and it would just turn out a bad storyline. So not that.) My second guess is Miles' dad. Miles' identity will get revealed to his mom (Those who have watched Ultimate Spider-man already know this. But I didn't watch the whole episode, and they probably didn't reveal any back story.), and his dad dies climatically, like his uncle.",True

@jonathanscores6478,2022-12-13T19:16:56Z,478,"Bro I can't mention enough how genuinely excited I feel about this. ITSV impacted my life so much and helped me thru a tough time during high school and I got to connect with good friends because of it. 

The story was by far one of the greatest narratives ever told in any medium for Spider-Man and seeing here how much it's importance was showing those moments again to present Mile's growth is beautiful (the editing to that was elite also)

Happy that we see Rio giving him guidance and love to not forget who he was that we all knew and love too cause damn that warmed my heart

Thank you Sony Animation, Kemp, Justin, Joaquim, Phil and Chris for all the years of effort you've been doing so far to make the last two films as special as they'll be for us.

I remember in the first film, the background smears were so much some people thought it was meant to be in 3D. Judging by 0:18 they're not dialling that back. I just hope this doesn't get to a point where they go so hard on the style that it becomes a problem.",True

Miles: has everyone he cares about, everyone loves him dearly but he pretends he's so lost and despressed all the time, Didn't really NEED to fight for anything just kinda got himself wrapped up in it. Gwen is basically his little lap dog attached to him for some reason even that 2099 be SMEXY FLEXIN ALL OVER THE PLACE.


This movie: ""ALL OF A SUDDEN NONE OF THE SPIDERS LIKE HIM AND WANT HIM DEAD""



Side note: Peter and Gwen were the only white people in the entire trailer, not a big deal at all, but worth pointing out seeing the world we live in these days. Gotta get that diversity money as long as it's majority non-white, CAN'T Have equal amounts, that would be equality and they don't want that.

@thehighground6871,2022-12-13T19:10:00Z,0,"Ok from when I paused on the shot where u see all the spiderman I see 

PS4 spiderman 
The bulletproof spiderman forgot his name 
Some kind of female iron spider
One that looks to be scarlet spider with a group of other spiders I can‚Äôt recognise 

In another shot I see the spiderman from the spiderman unlimited series I think that‚Äôs the one with the cape 

I see a superior Spider-Man
A spiderman that looks like toms new suit but could be a original spiderman with the original suit 
Paper bag man
Peter B Parker but we knew he would be back
A purple and green spiderman maybe a universe where prowler becomes spiderman 

In a shot where the spidermen are falling I see what looks like a red and black spiderman ps4 suit but I‚Äôm really unsure just the back logos are similar 

It‚Äôs really hard to tell what other spidermen there are and there mostly in the same shot",True

@gurieldaniel6004,2022-12-13T18:46:24Z,0,"looks to me like they're repeating the same storyline from last movie. let me explain my thoughts before jumping.
In the last movie, kingpin wanted to use the Super-Collider to enter the multiverse and find a world where he didn't lose his wife and son. In the trailer we see Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara) looking at a video of his daughter. I believed she died and he gonna try and bring her back, same as kingpin. that's why miles, Gwen and peter b. will try to stop him.
later on in the movie it will cause more trouble between the spider-men and they will have to explore the multiverse more, fighting different Spider-Man villains and meeting more spider-men. I believe it will lead eventuality to ""Spider-Geddon""- a multiverse war in the 2nd part , ""beyond the spider verse"". where peter b. and more spider-men will die.",True

And SpiderWoman Jessica Drew, they avoided race wash bs here. Thats clearly a different Jessica Drew altogether(looks like a mix of Jessica & the 70s SpiderWoman). Hell, her costume doesn't even look Spider-themed at all.

And thanks to Ultimate Alliance 1, Ive known for years that her powers arent the same as Peter's. So she shouldnt be a part of the SpiderVerse because she didnt get bitten by a radioactive spider. But this Jessica is.

And you know what? All they'd have to do is give regular Jessica Drew an appearance, and this black Jessica is all set.",True

That's cool, lots of big swingers have come inside the Spider-Man.

@DocumentaryFanboy,2022-12-13T18:21:59Z,0,"I'm gonna be the first to say this but I thought the first movie was extremley overrated. 
It was a mashup of so many diffrent tropes and styles that can work great on their own (superhero comics, manga, noir comics etc.), but make a confusing mess trying to find it's footing for the fans of all of them and failing miserably. 
The humor was weak, forced and bordered on cringe, but I've come to expect that from Marvel movies at this point. 
And finally it tried too hard to blend not only various Spider people, but also cram in as many villains as possible resulting in it being overly staturated. 
Don't get me wrong it's not an objectivley bad movie, it's just poorly structured, weak and tries too hard to be too many things. I still don't get why it won the Oscar for best animated feature film when I can name atleast 5 other far superior animated features that deserved this award more.",True

A Spider-Man wearing a version of the ASM Suit (2012) (Yellow Lenses ‚Äì Redesigned Torso) and Assassin Spider-Man of Earth-8351 (Black and Red Suit) talking.

An Alternate Version of PS4 Spidey wearing the Velocity Suit talking with a classic-suit Spider-Man.

The Spider, Peter Parker of Earth 15 ‚Äì In the far back.

PS4 Spider-Man wearing his 1st Game Advanced Suit (As opposed to the redesign for Spider-Man PS4 2) talking to Spider-Girl / Spider-Woman Mayday Parker wearing her original suit.

Spider-Cop alongside Spider-UK and Lady Spider.

Then Mangaverse Spidey in the far back. 

Alongside Mary Jane as Spinneret and Annie Parker from Renew Your Vows in the middle distance.

Then the Bombastic Bag-Man (Minus the f4 Suit) alongside a version of what I assume is Flash Thompson as Spider-Man.



With Werewolf Spider-Man on the far right. 


And Ofc a version of Spider-Woman (based on the logo) at 1:35.

I‚Äôm assuming Jessica Drew, but I could be wrong. 



From 1:55 we see:

Mayday again.

A version of Anya Cortez‚Äôs Spider-Woman / Ara√±a (the female Spider-Man in black)

Spider-Cop

A version of 6-armed Spider-Man (woman?)

The original design for the Spider-Armour MK 1. 

The Spider again.

And then a variant of MCU Peter wearing his Far From Home suit!

Alongside a version of the Black-Cat suit from the PS4 game. 



A version of Kaine Parker‚Äôs rendition of the Scarlet Spider. 


And then from 1:58 onward we have:

2 versions of the Spider.

A version of Future Foundation Spider-Man.

Web-Weaver in the far back (in yellow).

Spider Armour Mk II Spidey again, and also a Spidey wearing the Mk III. 

Flash Thompson Spider-Man again. 

Spider Monkey in the far back.

And a version of MJ‚Äôs Spider-Woman.

They weren't that good. They had a lot of the fun and world-jumping and wacky characters as these movies... but they didn't have any HEART.

I'm very grateful that Sony and its studios could see the core value of the Spider-verse but write BEYOND it, feel feelings beyond it, and create something where Miles and Peter and Gwen all feel real and vulnerable and, yes, wacky at times, but real. 

Can't wait for this June.

(PS: For anyone who wasn't read the comics, the main plot point is that instead of a scientist creating portals, it's vampires. Vampires that exclusively feed on Spider-Man, from different dimensions. I wish I could say I made that up. But it's dimension-jumping vampires that hop from world to world, eating Spider-Man in all his forms, until the last 30 or so of them band together to defeat the vampires, mainly by tricking them into jumping into a world with no spiders in it. I swear, this is the plot. It's very fun but so, so stupid.)",True

It doesn't matter if she has superpowers, that fetus is 100% dead. That's not being inclusive or brave, that's just being dumb on all angles. That's like putting an actual pregnant woman in the middle of the war zone. You just don't do it. If you're pregnant, then your number one priority is to be with that unborn child in a safe location where there isn't too much physical activity going on, so that the baby can be born & grow up to be strong & healthy.

- The Spiderman must have built a society of some sort after the previous movie. Hopefully we will see Madame Web in this.
- Spiderman 2099 is the villain in this one? As well as the other Spiderman? Could he be trying to change every single origin of the Spiderman, claiming he is helping them?
-No Peni, Noir or Spider-Ham yet. I hope they do appear in the movie, because i love them as well.

@PhaserFelix,2022-12-13T17:50:12Z,0,"Multiverse is an interesting yet very very boring topic. It makes everything have a reason while also everything useless.
A war won in my multiverse, is lost in another. My best friend killed by a gunshot wound, while in another stabbed. Multiverse is suchs a complicated topic, that it makes some viewers, like myself, kinda feeling like nothing makes sense anymore. Probably because we have yet to have anyone on our earth to understand multiverse or how it would work in a concept to the unwritten rules. If for example, I travel to another multiverse, does that mean there is an multiverse where I did not travel to another one?

Anyway I absolutely loved this movie, but what I wanted to say is that, she is spiderwoman in her multiverse, and he is spiderman in his multiverse. Does this mean that he is basically dating himself?

Both are in fact identified as spiderman/woman in their multiverse, the one and only. If he had not taken up the mask, does it mean she is an result of that, or is she an result of him being born as a women, what I am trying to say.

He is either dating himself, identified as a concept. Or he is dating a multiverse rule break, which basically means he created multiverses where he did not date her. Ima go back to something simpler than this.... Tetris anyone?",True

@nateislate5551,2022-12-13T17:48:54Z,0,"My Theory: 2099 Spider-Man got his daughter kidnapped by Spot and he's out to find him and anything that could relate to him. He then finds an anomaly in Mile's powers as they belong to a dimension separate from Mile's and now Miguel believes he could be working for Spot. I say this because in the first movie the spider that bit Miles glitched out like it was from another universe just like the other Spider-men in that movie. Spot is probably a big problem in this Citadel of Spider-Men which is why it's on site on Miles for everyone especially for 2099. 

Edit: I also noticed that 2099 Spider-Man had animator construction lines in a few shots, what could that mean?",True

@elisacastro720,2022-12-13T17:24:04Z,0,"My dear friend, I have an question for you: ‚Äúfor what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?"" Mark 8:36
It talks about gaining something that is temporary ‚Äì ‚Äúthe whole world‚Äù. But it also a talks about losing something that is eternal ‚Äì¬† your ‚Äúsoul‚Äù. Life is always a trade-off. Why would you lose your own soul? And there is only one answer to this question: your sin. My friend, look into your heart and you will not need any persuasion. Yes, we are sinful. And because of this you are forfeiting your own soul. Your sins makes of you an enemy of God ‚Äì the Judge above all judges, the Judge of all the earth. It‚Äôs an expensive trade-off. And to you I have good news! 
The Bible says, ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life‚Äù.(John 3: 16) Do you believe it? Terrible thing is to fall into the hands of the living God. And only Jesus, the son of God, through his death on the cross and the resurrection from the dead, can reconcile a sinner with God. He is a mighty Saviour for a great sinner. And Jesus is the one calling you today to repent of your sins and turn to Him. 
""Come to me, all who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for am I gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."" Matthew 11:28-30
Only Jesus can give us true happiness and peace. He cleans our conscience. And He gives us something not even death(and death takes everything from us) can take away: eternal life.",True

Also... please for the love of god... stop with the ""THE TRAILER BEGINS NOW"" bs. We know. That's why we clicked on the video. We don't need a TRAILER for the TRAILER. The trailer is for the movie and we're here to see the trailer for the movie, not to see the trailer for the trailer in 5 seconds and then see it followed up with the actual trailer.
