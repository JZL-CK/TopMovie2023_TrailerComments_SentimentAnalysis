Never was made a movie through this perspective and it makes it original. The way how a ""boss""  from millitia would speak of people, like ""casualties"", using codes and all that is something happening in all wars, and it gives a brief comprehension on how you need disassociation from reality in order to accomplish the most cruel orders against strangers, dehumanized in every way... movie even had an unexpectedly funny scene almost at the end😂",True

@WhatsInAName718,2024-04-03T20:09:53Z,4,"Is it just me, or was this the most pointless movie you've ever watched? I don't get it... nothing happens. It's just a boring family, a dude with an ungrateful bitch of a wife who wants to go to a spa, so he decides to let some other girl suck his dick (I assume, as we don't even see THAT much), and then he gets transferred, throws up a bit and then ends. 

The final scene showing the shoes of those lost on display showed the scale of the holocaust, but that could have been the front cover of the movie and not bothered with the motion picture. The only reason this movie has 7/10 on IMDB is because it would be offensive to give it the 1/10 it deserves due to it's nature and would result in the critics and any affiliates being cancelled.

But think over how you paint hoess as a following orders guy and trying to trivialize his actions. I’m sure you wouldn’t do such a run on himmler. Both just as evil!

I protest with a loudspeaker that even if I were not Jewish, I’d NEVER compare the Gaza situation with nazi germany. It’s hurtful and mean. Nobody compares British and American invasion in Germany to Nazis either. You just don’t…

In spite of the distant faint gunshots, screams, train noises which are no doubt from the frequent exterminations in the camp, the Hess family along with the maids, gardeners who work in the house try to maintain normalcy.  This movie reminds of the 1970 film The Garden of the Finzi-Continis where it also depicted an opulent family's mundane life in their estate at the outset of WW2 except they're Jewish and movie ends with the family getting sent to the concentration camp. The Hess family here is also headed to their doom with the eventual death of Hitler and the downfall of the Nazis.

I would have luxuriated in the stolen fur coat thinking that it would be of no use to the owner now so I might as well enjoy it. 
I would remain stubbornly stuck in my narrow little 'perfect' world enjoying a standard of living I could previously only have dreamed of all the while turning a blind eye to the Hell unfolding all around my little island of petit bourgeois perfection.
I have known ex-pat wives in Africa and the Middle East just like her.
They walk past lepers begging in the dirt on their way to the swimming pool in the British Club where they read about the Royal Family in the Daily Mail and moan about how tough their life is.
They live in the lap of luxury in the Gulf while turning a blind eye to the horrors of the Indian slave labour building the skyscrapers around them and bully their Filipina servants.
They are greedy, mean spirited, narrow and snobbish. Incredibly mercenary and selfish.

@foley15136,2024-02-18T19:33:54Z,0,"Yes. We should never forget. We should teach each generation what happened and never let it happen again. But, two questions:
1. Why are there no movies or shows about what the communists did? They murdered far more than did the Nazis. Including Jews. They murdered tens, or maybe even hundreds of millions more people than the Nazis. No movies. No shows. And the newer generations love the system that caused that. They absolutely love it and call others Nazis. Ironically, their ideology is responsible for more death than the Nazis. I’m not defending Naziism (obligatory disclaimer for some reason). I’m saying both are horrible and one is worse than the other. 

2. Far-leftists today condemn Nazis (as they should), but at the same time want all Jews wiped out in Israel. They don’t want Jews to even have a country. I suppose killing Jews is bad when White people do it, but when non-Whites do it, it’s necessary and heroic. How do they hold those two contradictory thoughts in their heads?",True

@onegathers,2024-02-09T17:29:50Z,1,"Just been to the cinema to see 'Zone of interest', the latest film by the brilliant Jonathan Glazer, whose Under the skin was my favourite film of 2013.
Telling the story of Höss, kommandant of Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp, and the idyllic life he has with his children and horses in the house built next to the death camp. Much of the film concerns banal incidents, his socially ambitious wife showing guests around her house while Polish servants scurry out of her way. 
What is extraordinary however is the sound design of the film. Below the everyday chit chat are a low, endless and menacing drone, with screams, guard dogs, gun fire, trains arriving, yells in German a constant background of unspeakable horror.
Höss comes across in the film like he came across in the book he wrote waiting for the hangman: caring for his own children while murdering other people's children daily in their thousands, uncaring and aloof...in his book he slags off all his fellow SS, doing them no favours in their upcoming trials.

@jorditorro6273,2024-01-25T22:13:58Z,0,"SPOILER. The film is so scary because its concepts reveal how history can repeat itself. The protagonists and their children trivialize the horror happening next to them. They see normal hearing bees buzzing as well as the constant sound of shots or how their bedroom turns orange from the light of the flames coming from the chambers. However, we see how the grandma feels the horror leaving her unease while the others just enjoy their pretty cozy house. That’s why this generation could end up doing the same since hatred is winning in politics again. And also the thesis arrives with that flash forward to the present where Auschwitz has become a Theme Park for people. It’s such a brilliant film.",True

@sukhmaidickoff,2024-01-11T16:50:58Z,3,"This movie is long overdue. Don´t get me wrong. I am not ""hating"" on Germans who live in 2024 and I am NOT blaming them for what their ancestors did ++80 years ago. I haven´t watched the movie yet - but I have heard and read a lot about it. The movie raises an important question: How much did the ""normal"" German citizen know about the Concentration camps? It is VERY difficult to believe that basically and allegedly no Germans knew about the Concentration camps and what happened inside them. People must have been wondering how thousands of railroad waggons could arrive with people and no railroad waggon ever left the place again with people. People must have been wondering what happened to those people who arrived in railroad waggons. The local people near the Concentration camps worked in those camps. Don´t tell me they did NOT know what happened.

I live in a Scandinavian country. I have several friends in Germany. Among them a 73 year old woman - born in 1950, so she wasn´t alive when all this happened. However. I found it difficult to believe when she told me last time she visited me: *_""My parents, and the Germans in general did not know what was going on in the concentration camps""_* - Like I said - I find that VERY hard to believe - and research done by reputable historians has also concluded that many Germans very well knew what happened there.

My point is: Germans who claim that the broad German population did not know about this - are simply not telling the truth. Germans who lived back then had a RESPONSIBILITY for doing something against those atrocities. Doing nothing and being totally passive when atrocities like these happen is NEVER a legitimate reason to say: ""I was not guilty - I did not put those jews into gas chambers"". YES - you are also guilty if you don´t react to atrocities and stay passive. That applies to Germans who lived back then just like it applies to Russians who don´t give a shaite that Putin is committing atrocities in the Ukraine.

It is beyond my imagination how some Germans could work in the concentration camps during daytime - look at hundred thousands or ""prisoners"" who were basically ""skin and bones"" and who clearly suffered - and they must also have seen how many people died. They watched how many people got tortured. They saw how there were kids there suffering - and many of those kids also died. 

And many of those Germans who saw all these atrocities and crimes against humanity on a daily basis - they then after work went home to their families - had a barbeque and cake and played in the garden with their kids, like ABSOLUTELY nothing had happened. I will NEVER like in NEVER understand how people can watch this and not be affected and not care about it.",True

""Both read the Bible day and night.
But thou read'st black where I read white.""

With the Holocaust it is exactly the same.


Some people understand and learn from it, that genocide is evil, and that such things must never happen again.
Some people learn: the other is evil and dangerous, we must become strong and everyone must fear us, we must annihilate the other, before he annihilates us ...
Some people think spiritual and abstract, some people´s thoughts are tribal.
Idealists versus Nationalists.
Some are courageous, some are guided by fear.
Some people choose heaven and some people choose hell.
