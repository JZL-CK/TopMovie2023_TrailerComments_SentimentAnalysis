It brought back the human element, the improv, the learning on the fly. That was interesting, compared to fast-paced explosions nowadays where all the effects suffocate the personal experience. And the train was a great dragged out suspense where one escape invoked in its success and failure the need for yet another and another escape. Beautiful.

The storyline, narrative, film making and visual are fantastic. I have to say this was incredibly brave to do and without giving anything away, this trailer does a brilliant job at keeping it all secretive without spoiling it. It's a type of movie that requires a lot of attention and listening. The script writing is done very cleverly and actually gets away with what they are tackling. The stunts with the music is truly an experience worth having. It does feel different to the past few movies, and I would liken it to feeling more closely related to MI3, but the comedy saves it from getting overwhelming.",True

@cocotower,2023-07-19T23:37:34Z,0,"The Only best way to experience this movie is by IMAX. As for the plot, it's the most unrealistic fantasy world plot I've ever watched.  The plot is hard to endure, but everything else makes up for that.  For example, this ""entity"" somehow knows what everybody is thinking.  It is also controlling the thoughts of all the competing characters tangled up in the battle for the ""key"".  In a way, it's suggested that you yourself could be a secret agent and don't even know it, because the entity could be using you along the way of its goal.  So, the sexy brunette lady in this movie finds herself not only drawn in but ultimately asks to join the secret program, and you get the feeling that she was being tested on trial by somebody.  This movie comes close to plagiarizing the 90s movie ""Identity"".",True

@oleksandrvladimirov9852,2023-07-16T22:10:43Z,0,"Even though it was a fun movie in general, all the moments mentioning russians were extremely disturbing and deceiving… The creators named a russian submarine “Sevostopol”, a city in Ukraine, Republic of Crimea, which was occupied by russia. Currently, Ukraine defends its lands from the russian occupants and stands for world’s democracy. Yet, Hollywood films still utilise (I hope unintentionally) a pro-russian perspective.. 

To me it shows certain amount of ignorance towards the understanding of the modern world, and the amount of russian narratives and propaganda around the world that has existed for the last couple of centuries. Hollywood must stop being ignorant and communicating these dangerous narratives for such a huge audience…",True

Even though story is unique to its franchise they have dragged the movie too much to cover up a thin plot.

Great work from the director and the performance from the whole cast was masterful. 
Why oh why do other producers push garbage, when this is what the audience actually wants. A thriller with a compelling modern storyline that’s got a complex array of characters that make it interesting to watch.

I'm just talkin' 'bout Mission Impossible.. self destruct yo' mouf.. can you dig it? 😂 Suggested stunt: have Tom Cruise run the length of an operating helicopter blade into do a somersault to just barely grasp a burning rope that just happens to be hanging from a Zeppelin whose helium supply was just been exhausted.

@user-fv4wr1bz4n,2023-06-01T16:11:22Z,0,"為正在各種煩惱或病苦中、障礙特別多，或自覺會短壽的有緣人（請加油！不用灰心），介紹一部專為此類問題而設的佛經——「藥師經、藥師咒」。此經咒字數雖少但福德佛力極大，若能讀誦、書寫、印經或轉發經文，讓更多人接觸到，即能得到消災、治病、延壽、滅罪、增福、衣食豐足、所求如願等無量福德利益，轉業改命，復得健康長壽的快樂人生。即使你自覺無病無苦，它還是可以增加你無量福報，因為多念誦也能在冥冥中使此經咒為更多此世界的人所接觸到，由此增加了他們的健康壽命財富等，從而使你累積極大的善業福德，人生各方面都能更進一步。你亦可為有需要的親友念誦迴向亦能有效。所以勸大家多多讀誦、轉發，累積無量改命功德。（當然平日行為也要盡量改惡向善）（看見此文「點讚隨喜」也能有一份功德）（南無「僧伽吒經」，若得見此經名即能滅罪。）

藥師經全文六千多字，有興趣可自行搜尋（篇幅所限貼不出來），最好念誦全文。但若覺字數太多，也可選擇單誦藥師經的核心部分或藥師咒、心咒或名號等。藥師經咒，求治病延壽最是靈驗，亦可求財、滿願、亦可往生西方和得人天護佑等。*但若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。並且可在每天早上對一杯清水念藥師咒108遍然後給患者喝下去，這樣會更有效。(雖說能治病，但還是該去看醫生的，但它能讓你冥冥中總會遇到更好的醫藥治療，且你身體的自癒能力也會更強，亦能得藥師佛力之加持，故亦的確有可能不藥而癒。若念誦的量和質都足夠高，則醫生都治不好的重病亦有可能治癒。)

藥師經的核心部分（經心）只有約一千字，更方便持誦，且已包括藥師經最主要的功德利益，全文如下：

「復次、曼殊室利！若有四眾：苾芻、苾芻尼、鄔波索迦、鄔波斯迦，及餘淨信善男子、善女人等，有能受持八分齋戒，或經一年、或復三月受持學處，以此善根，願生西方極樂世界無量壽佛所聽聞正法而未定者，若聞世尊藥師琉璃光如來名號，臨命終時，有八大菩薩，其名曰：文殊師利菩薩，觀世音菩薩，得大勢菩薩，無盡意菩薩，寶檀華菩薩，藥王菩薩，藥上菩薩，彌勒菩薩。是八大菩薩乘空而來，示其道路，即於彼界種種雜色眾寶華中，自然化生」。
 
「或有因此，生於天上，雖生天上，而本善根，亦未窮盡，不復更生諸餘惡趣。天上壽盡，還生人間，或為輪王，統攝四洲，威德自在，安立無量百千有情於十善道；或生剎帝利、婆羅門、居士大家，多饒財寶，倉庫盈溢，形相端嚴，眷屬具足，聰明智慧，勇健威猛，如大力士。若是女人，得聞世尊藥師琉璃光如來名號，至心受持，於後不復更受女身」。
 
「復次、曼殊室利！彼藥師琉璃光如來得菩提時，由本願力，觀諸有情，遇眾病苦瘦攣、乾消、黃熱等病；或被厭魅、蠱毒所中；或復短命，或時橫死；欲令是等病苦消除，所求願滿」。
 
「時彼世尊，入三摩地，名曰除滅一切眾生苦惱。既入定已，於肉髻中出大光明，光中演說，大陀羅尼曰：『那謨薄伽筏帝，裨殺社，窶嚕，薜琉璃，缽剌婆，喝囉闍也，怛陀揭多耶，阿羅訶帝，三藐三勃陀耶。怛姪阤：唵，鞞殺逝，鞞殺逝，鞞殺社，三沒揭帝娑訶』」。爾時、光中說此咒已，大地震動，放大光明，一切眾生病苦皆除，受安隱樂。
 
「曼殊室利！若見男子、女人有病苦者，應當一心，為彼病人，常清淨澡漱，或食、或藥、或無蟲水、咒一百八遍，與彼服食，所有病苦悉皆消滅。若有所求，志心念誦，皆得如是，無病延年；命終之後，生彼世界，得不退轉，乃至菩提。是故曼殊室利！若有男子、女人，於彼藥師琉璃光如來，至心殷重，恭敬供養者，常持此咒，勿令廢忘」。
 
「復次、曼殊室利！若有淨信男子女人，得聞藥師琉璃光如來應正等覺所有名號，聞已誦持。晨嚼齒木，澡漱清淨，以諸香花，燒香、塗香，作眾伎樂，供養形象。於此經典，若自書，若教人書，一心受持，聽聞其義。於彼法師，應修供養：一切所有資身之具，悉皆施與，勿令乏少。如是便蒙諸佛護念，所求願滿，乃至菩提」。
 
爾時、曼殊室利童子白佛言：「世尊！我當誓於像法轉時，以種種方便，令諸淨信善男子、善女人等，得聞世尊藥師琉璃光如來名號，乃至睡中亦以佛名覺悟其耳。世尊！若於此經受持讀誦。或復為他演說開示；若自書、若教人書；恭敬尊重，以種種華香、塗香、末香、燒香、花鬘、瓔珞、幡（番）蓋、伎樂，而為供養；以五色綵，作囊盛之；掃灑淨處，敷設高座，而用安處。爾時、四大天王與其眷屬，及餘無量百千天眾，皆詣其所，供養守護。世尊！若此經寶流行之處，有能受持，以彼世尊藥師琉璃光如來本願功德，及聞名號，當知是處無復橫死；亦復不為諸惡鬼神奪其精氣，設已奪者，還得如故，身心安樂。」

梵音藥師咒之國語註音：（可參考相關YouTube影片學習發音）*若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。
「那摩 巴噶瓦爹 白薩加 咕嚕 外度裡呀 缽啊巴 喇加呀 達踏嘎達呀 啊喇爹 三藐三布達呀， 達滴呀踏，嗡，白沙接 白沙接 白沙駕 三目嘎爹 刷哈」

藥師佛心咒國語註音：
「嗲雅他唵 貝看傑 貝看傑 瑪哈貝看傑 喇札沙母恩嘎得 梭哈」

藥師解冤咒：（此咒可除了具治病延壽之效，還能解冤消業，可以消去與冤家的恩怨，使人際關係變好，夫妻和睦等）
「解結解結解冤結  解了多生冤和業
洗心滌慮發虔誠  今對佛前求解結
藥師佛  藥師佛  消災延壽藥師佛  隨心滿願藥師佛」

若仍覺經咒太長或難學，亦可單誦藥師佛之聖號：南無藥師琉璃光如來或南無藥師佛。當然重申一遍，經咒威力功德當然是據字數之多少而等而下之的，所以最好是誦經典全文，只是為了方便，所以才有更便於持誦的經心或咒語部分，但當然你念字數更少的法若想要有跟讀經一遍相同之功德，就該念誦更多遍了。
*但若急於治病，建議專誦咒語，越多越好。

其他咒語：

（專治癌症、瘤、痔瘡、炎症等）佛說療痔病陀羅尼.(請參看相關經文)
國語註音:
「達底呀踏，啊藍爹 ，啊藍美，薛瑞比，薛瑞，薛瑞，嘛嘎西基，三拔哇度，刷哈
嗡， 夏美，夏美，灑夏美，夏麻內，灑夏泥，刷哈」

(專治眼疾)梵音清淨眼秘密陀羅尼.(請參看相關經文)
國語註音:（可參考相關YouTube影片學習發音）
「 達底呀踏 嘻利 彌利 己利 嘻嘿噠  護友護友 護呀威底，
 護魯護魯護魯 嘟嘟 嘟嘟嚕，拿摩布達呀舌
 巴嘎哇嘟 西底樣嘟 曼得拉  巴噠 刷哈」

（滅罪最簡單有效的咒）善住滅罪心咒：「嗡 媽尼 乏及里 吽」

（增福最簡單有效的咒）雨寶心咒：「嗡 乏蘇 達咧 刷哈」

（降魔護身簡單有效的咒）大白傘蓋佛母心咒：「吽 媽媽 吽尼 刷哈」

t＊順便為有興趣的人再推介一些殊勝經咒：「長壽滅罪經、佛頂尊勝咒、不空摩尼供養咒、準提咒、大日如來光明真言、觀音治病咒、聖六字增壽咒、百字明（皆可在YouTube搜到）」都對消罪增福、治病延壽有很大功效。

（專消業治病）觀音治病咒：Ong 避路拉基 堅都喜哈 避沙嘛 些哈木 堅都奇悲些拉達 避拉呀 刷哈

*若仍嫌麻煩，可單誦「南無觀世音菩薩」為入門，救急救苦，每求必驗，遇上任何大大小小的苦惱困難皆可念誦，多持誦也能得消罪增福、延壽生西、福德無量。",True

Just a fun, entertaining movie that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I have a feeling this new Mission Impossible is going to do the same. I do hope more movies will get back to this, the beautiful experience of escapism. Where they tell a story to entertain and inspire. I truly hope that Hollywood gets back to that.

US government entity either underestimates or wants to end the MI program
yourmissionifyouchoosetoacceptit exposition thismissionisIMPOSIBLE exposition thismessagewillselfdestruct
sweeping establishing shot of Beirut/ Geneva/ Barcelona 
Benji beeps and boops in back of van while Luther looks worried and bemused at the same time.
A hard decision is presented, only Ethan can do this job. 
Tom Cruise does his full range of *jaw acting*
More exposition about the mission plan, which inevitably falls apart 5-10 minutes into the mission.  
Tom Cruise looks tight and fit while sprinting. 
PARKOUR! 
Rebecca Ferguson saves everyone from their own idiocy AGAIN
so. many. motorcycles. and maybe also a HELICOPTER that will definitely stay fully intact. 
tom cruise will be suspended from some sort of cable over an abyss with a comical amount of fans, he will leave unscathed apart from one aesthetic eyebrow cut
Double agent is revealed! 
IT WAS ETHAN/ BENJI IN A MASK THE WHOLE TIME?!
Uh Oh, Vaguely European Villian might just win and the stakes have never been higher. 
Ethan spends 5 minutes beating himself up for choosing to save a loved one over the mission... 
but then that becomes his motivation to put himself through the equivalent of a 30 car pile up 
The clock is counting down to 5... 4.. 3... 2...

One.    a movie with loud explosions , vehicular flamboyance, guns and contract killer type skill set.  This genre of movie is so boring.
Keanu reeves
Jason statham
Liam neeson
Tom cruise
Clint Eastwood 
All these people do these kinds of films and it’s Hollywood screenwriting 101 to cater to the low brow people that awe and clap at explosions.   “OH BOY EXPLOSIONS! LOUD NOISES! ACTION BOY FIGHT SCENES!”    
My Nigerian these things are so tired
This movie genre is so tired and way too often regurgitated.    I can’t give Tom cruise anymore credit for doing his own stunts as if that somehow makes me want to watch anymore than I DONT already. I know this comment is gonna get a lot of hate and that’s all cool dOOd.    It’s such a tired movie genre and movie title in itself.

@justinbro2002,2023-05-18T11:50:40Z,0,Say what you will about Tom Cruise's personal life or religion but the man's commitment to making excellent movies is unparalleled.  For the better part of four decades he has managed to only have a few movies that didn't hit their mark. I am still disappointed that the Jack Reacher franchise ended after only two movies. Maverick was pure perfection and the MI movies have somehow only gotten better with every sequel. You can't say that about very many franchises i.e. Fast and Furious. If the dead reckoning twin movies are really the mission impossible swag song I will be sad to see it end but I am at least optimistic that it will end on a high note.,True

Another major point, a lot of dialogues have ""written"" word in it.

Mission: Impossible is the greatest action movie series in history. One of the few franchises where each title manages to surpass the predecessor, insane. Only the second exception movie, but it's still pure entertainment.

Cruise is my favorite working actor. His delivery, his perfectionism and his madness always provided the magic of the Seventh Art. The lack of stuntmen and the little use of VFX/CGI show the size of its name. A perfect career, no mistakes. The Mummy doesn't exist, it's just a collective delusion.",True

Mark my words, this film is going to be the biggest blockbuster in the entire Mission Impossible film franchise. I won't miss this film at any cost. Hats off to the entire cast and crew of Mission Impossible Film Series for creating this greatest action spy franchise. Tom Cruise you're truly one of the best action hero I've ever seen in my whole life. Goosebumps Guaranteed. 📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽📽🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥",True

@DivijSonak,2023-05-17T14:02:08Z,0,"The turnaround that this franchise has had is amazing. Most movies peak at their sequels and it's all downhill from there. Mission: Impossible though, has just been getting consistently better and better, not just at the scale and stakes of its action sequences, but also with the gravitas in its storytelling. Finding its niche in Cruise's done-for-real action sequences, it's gone from a decent action entertainer to one of the most anticipated two-parters of this year and the next.

And that trailer score is just riveting, incorporating Lalo Schifrin's classic Mission: Impossible theme in the archetypal background trailer music. Terrific stuff!",True
