@TimBrianTufuga,2024-01-17T13:35:49Z,1,"Superbly written depicting the problems faced by any First Nations people world over. The bane of Colonialism and the contact between the Opportunist European with the First Nations people, whether in North America, Australia, Africa, New Zealand or the Pacific Islands, within Central America and South America, or Asia, the storyline is the same. Colonialism and the Black Man's burden of Colonialism is a universal experience felt by all First Nations people. 

The Storyline of the Osage Nation and their Black Gold was a curse in disguise when opportunist White Men, and Clansmen at that, would deliberately marry Indians for their Oil money seems very obvious. From Conniving Lawyers, Corruptible and murdering Police Officers, to ooportunists Servants and Chauffuers, the opportunity to woe a Coloured, and rich, Osage Indian would be too tempting to resist. Murders and blood money pay outs would be an opportunity to knock two birds with one stone for opportunist White Folks. 

This also reflects on the insincerity of many race relations and miscegenation marriages which in this instance would reveal how the KKK men married the Osage Indian Women and would, in the end, be responsible for the surreptitious murders of numerous Indians, including the wives of these unscrupulous White Men. 

What is even worse, is how these pernicious men, like the sincere White Missionary, would profess to be culturally sensitive when in truth they were the murderers and exploiters of the very same people they were professing to protect and to advocate in their intersts to the world. The paradox of enlightenment.

Honestly,the best film director is Quentin Tarantino.His films are flawless and full with emotions,great acting,beautiful soundtrack as well as important stories.
Not to be rude but Django Unchained is a way better western than Killers of The Flower Moon film adaptation.
Quentin Tarantino is better than Martin Scorsese because Tarantino appreciates all the films,even the superhero movies.

In an attempt to tell the Ossage story all Scorsese did was depict them as hapless and helpless. You watch 2 and a 1/2 hours of them being killed by white men and then dum ta ta ta, the calvary shows up in the form of the Bureau of investigation.  This is the white savior movie of white savior movies exactly what I know Scorsese was trying to avoid. The Ossage have no agency. The only agency they demonstrate is running to some white man i.e. a private detective or the feds.

Does anyone actually enjoy these two's performances here?  It's such a down story why pepper it with these two lifeless thug actors who have played the same people their entire career minus bad accents.  The subject matter would have been better committed by establishing an FBI (or whatever it was then) character going undercover and solving the crime from his point of view and of the victims rather than DiCaprio and DeNero.

We owe reparations to Native Americans and Black people. 1/2 of US War Budgets should be set aside every year for reparations to both groups that have been harmed since the beginning of the United States of America. We must reclaim morality and reality here.

May I also remind you the fact that our Native American population in our motherland, the Continent of America before the European Colonizers arrived, was around 15 millions, while the European population in their motherland, the Continent of Europe was around 25 millions.
Today, Native American population is 15 million, while the European population, in the Continents of America + Europe, is a staggering TWO BILLION! A shocking sad truth.  😔
 In my humble opinion, it's about time to decolonize the Colonized lands, and return it to rightful owners Native American people.

Then Covid hit and it was put on hold. I felt like I had to wait forever for this film to finally come out and was so excited, I went to see it the first day. First, let me say it was a well-told story about the horrific plight of the Osage, a story that needed to be told, but I was still disappointed. At nearly 3.5 hours long I really expected there to be a bit more about the FBI's investigation, like there was in the book. The subtitle of the book is ""The Osage Murders AND THE BIRTH OF THE FBI"". It was the FBI's and J. Edgar Hoover's first big case. They sent in undercover agents and investigated for more than 2 years, yet the movie made it look like Tom White just swept in there and had it all wrapped up in a couple of weeks. The trials of Hale and his nephews lasted nearly 3 years, through changes of venue, hung juries, appeals, and overturned verdicts, before they were finally sentenced.

They were treated like garbage.
The men women and children.
They had beautiful life until they were told to leave.
If they didn’t they would have been tortured and killed.
They were also used as slaves.
When they all left they went to live in mountains away from soldiers so they wouldn’t be destroyed.

De Niro gives a brilliant performance but De Caprio is less than satisfying, partly because of some illicit diversions from the real character,, to make him look more sympathetic for cinematic purposes, and the movie drags on toward a predictable conclusion.  In Grann's book we learn of death of hundreds by the whites and the movie plays it, i.e., the genocide, down.

@KingOFuh,2023-10-25T01:07:31Z,1,"San Pedro News Pilot, June 9, 1926; CONFESSES TO THREE OSAGE INDIAN DEATHS Burkhart Ends Trial by His Dramatic Admission (United Press) PAWHUSKA, Oklahoma, June 9--Ernest Burkhart voluntarily pleaded guilty to murdering W. E. Smith during the Osage reign of terror, during his trial on that charge here today. The end of the trial came with dramatic suddenness after Burkhart discharged all of his attorneys except Flint Moss of Tulsa, and announced he had a statement to make in open court. Burkhart stood before Judge Jess E. Wortem and said: “I want to confess that nothing I have said in court has been the truth.” Judge Wortem then questioned Burkhart as to whether he had been influenced or promised any sort of immunity in exchange for making a confession. Burkhart answered the judge’s questions negatively. Judge Wortem announced he would sentence Burkhart June 21. An intimation of something out of the ordinary came when court opened. Moss said that he believed the case on trial could be concluded quickly if the judge would grant a recess. Judge Worten granted the request and there followed a conference of Moss and states attorneys. Following the conference, court reconvened and Burkhart’s plea of guilty followed. In his written statement Burkhart declared he dynamited the Smith home, at which time Smith and his wife and a servant girl were killed, at the request of his uncle, William K. Hale, who, with John Ramsey, is charged jointly with the Smith murders. Ramsey and Hale are also under federal indictment on charges of murdering Henry Roan Horse, Osage Indian. It was charged by the state that Hale was the ringleader of a plot to murder Osage Indians for their wealth. More than 20 persons met untimely deaths during 1922. The year was known in Oklahoma as the “Osage reign of terror.”",True

Osage County Officers Are Still Looking for Brown Murderer; Tuesday, August 30, 1921; FAIRFAX, August 29--Bryant and Ernest Burkhart, taxi owners and drivers of Fairfax, have been arrested and confined in the Osage County Jail for alleged complicity in the murder of Mrs. Anna Brown, the Osage Indian wife of Oat Brow of Ponca City, about 90 days ago near Grayhorse in the western Osage. The woman was found in the brush with a bullet hole in the top of her head. Thus far, six different persons have been arrested but four have been released after examination. Officers are working on the theory that the murder was committed to cover up robbery. In probing this case, a continuous coroner's jury is held, meeting whenever desired at the call of the presiding official to hear new evidence.",True

@motti6569,2023-10-22T23:13:57Z,1,"Another Native American story that should be told, but that has not really been ever told on a national level: Henry Berry Lowry.

Henry Berry Lowry was basically a real life Robin Hood crossed with Django unchained. Lumbee were being actively enslaved by the confederacy to build fortifications on the coast and having their land seized during the civil war. So it was deeply personal when Henry Berry Lowry launched a guerilla style war, inglorious basterds style against confederates and plantation owners across southern NC. With a multi racial gang/group of supporters, he would show up to Confederates churches, plantations, etc. and burn, loot and free slaves. The man killed Confederate home guard soldiers and would show up silent like the wind in the homes of the families of those he killed and apologize for the life he had taken. Lowry once took out an entire platoon of Confederate home guard with only a canoe and a pistol. Loot he stole, he redistributed to the poor of Robeson county - whether they were white, black or native.

Man was so prolific that he was the most wanted man in America for decades in an era that people otherwise remember Wild West outlaws. This and Lumbee history of opposing the racism in the South, from serving as scouts to Sherman's March or actively terrorizing the Klan out of their territory made it so despite being one of the largest Native American peoples in the US and the largest on the east coast, they never received full Federal Recognition",True

Her journey from the picturesque landscapes of Montana to the bustling streets of Hollywood has made her a rising star known for her grace and versatility on screen.
Raised on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana, Lily has always had a deep connection to her Tribal heritage. Her upbringing instilled in her a profound appreciation for storytelling and the natural world, which would later become essential elements of her artistic expression.
Gladstone's breakout moment came with her role in ""Certain Women"" (2016), a film directed by Kelly Reichardt. In this anthology film, she portrayed Jamie, a quiet ranch hand who becomes infatuated with an out-of-town lawyer, beautifully capturing the longing and isolation of her character. Her performance was great, earning her critical acclaim and paving the way for further opportunities in the industry.
For all you gamers out there, she also played a main role in the critically acclaimed video game ""The Last of Us Part II"" (2020), where she lent her voice and likeness to the character of ""Dina."" The game's emotionally charged complex characters resonated with players worldwide, and Gladstone's contribution was integral to its success.
Her most recent as well as biggest project, ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" is a testament to her commitment of telling Native stories. Directed by Martin Scorsese, and starring Leonardo DiCaprio the film explores the tragedy of the Osage people of Oklahoma. Gladstone's portrayal of Mollie Burkhart, should deliver a performance nothing short of remarkable.
Beyond her acting prowess, she is an advocate for Native representation in Hollywood. She believes in the power of storytelling to foster understanding and empathy across cultures and strives to be a voice for Tribal communities.
In a world where diversity and inclusion are paramount, her legacy underscores the importance of authentic representation while breaking down barriers in the entertainment industry.
Although Buffy Sainte-Marie, was the first Native woman to win an Oscar for best original music, congratulations by the way. Here’s to hoping Lily can be the first Native Woman to win for acting. I have a very strong feeling that she will.
