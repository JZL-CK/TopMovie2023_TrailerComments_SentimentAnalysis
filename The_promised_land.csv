We have the power to stop these creatures.  They have raised new fascists on the lands of Ukraine and, using Russia, are trying to incite hatred throughout the world, turning Russia‚Äôs protection from NATO into aggression.  The Russian people do not want a repeat of the first and second world wars, when millions of people died.  But the Western media in every possible way distort the true state of affairs, as was the case during the Second World War.

@SOHANSINGHRAJPOOT,2024-05-10T08:52:43Z,0,"I loved it, a historical and biographical film full of feelings. A heartbreaking story of a cruel and classist Denmark, which reveals how social classes divide us and bring out the worst in human beings. A character who does not allow himself to be intimidated and undertakes a battle so unequal that he will put not only his life at risk, but also the family of marginalized people that has formed around him. Ludvig Kahlen is an outcast, a bastard who longs for a noble title, a title that is far from giving him happiness and, above all, dignity. A Mads Mikkelsen who perfectly embodies a man devastated by poverty, misunderstanding and disdain for a solitary life. A man who only hopes to live his dream...serve the king!",True

@movingmindsetministry,2024-02-11T00:56:24Z,0,"The prophetic checklist is nearly complete for Mystery Babylon‚Äîonly 1 left!

‚úîÔ∏èAmerica is a fallen state, a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird (Rev. 18:2).

It is the land locked up with idolatry, iniquity, heresy, lawlessness, deception, and everything in between.

‚úîÔ∏èAll the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her luxury.‚Äù (Rev. 18:3).

Through government spending, trade, commerce, and exportation, kings of nations who sit as world rulers have lavished in the financial markets of America.

‚úîÔ∏èFor your merchants were the great men of the earth, for by your sorcery (medicine) all the nations were deceived (Rev. 18:23).

2020 was the climax to ages of deception through prescriptions, creating record profits for the most successful dope dealers in the industry‚Äîas the world closed its doors‚Äîwaiting for the solution from the supposed health experts.

‚úîÔ∏èAnd by the hand of this satanic empire, the blood of Hebrew prophets, the Holy people, and of all who were slain on the earth was shed (Rev. 18:24).

In the name of freedom and the interest of the government, not the people, the US of A and the nations it fornicated with, has and continues to sweep through land after land, spilling the blood of all peoples. 

What remains for the land of the bravely destructive and freedom stealer?

Lastly #5! Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, ‚ÄúThus with violence, the great city Babylon will be thrown down, and will NOT be found again.‚Äù ‚ÄîRev. 18:25

A millstone, created in the 5th century BC, is used to grind grain into flour.

The Holy Word declares that this great millstone will land in the sea.

The sea is made up of people, multitudes, nations, and tongues (Rev 17:15).

Within the heart of the peoples in Babylon, with hearts for America, a tremendous stone will dropped, erupting into total violence‚Äîleading fornicating nations to follow suit.

Time to come out of Babylon‚Äîsin (Rev. 18:4).
