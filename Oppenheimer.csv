@user-cw9io2kp5y,2024-05-28T08:10:48Z,0,"Пора говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ , имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА , либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА , либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит , каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. ""ПРИВОДИТЬ"" НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. 

МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. Под видом исторического сюжета скрывается обычная ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА И пример МАНИПУЛЯЦИИ душой человека, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое УПОМИНАНИЕ в фильме О БОГЕ, ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), а главное название этой небогоугодной операции это обычное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО), самый СТРАШНЫЙ ГРЕХ если прельститься. НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества СТРАШНЫХ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ таких как ЛУКАВСТВО, ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ПОХОТЬ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, ВИНОПИТИЕ, и КУРЕНИЕ. И ВОТ ТАК, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ, ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. И ПОЧЕМУ МАНИПУЛЯЦИЯ. «ПРИОРИТЕТНЫМ» демоном который завладевает душой человека при просмотре фильма, если конечно он уже не находится в душе, а если находится тогда усиливается бесами соответствующей порочной страсти, потому что он фактически из них и состоит, БУДЕТ ДЕМОН МУЧИТЕЛЬ КУРЕНИЯ, ПОТОМУ ЧТО КАК реально примерно ВЫГЛЯДИТ ЭТОТ ДЕМОН в своём «человеческом» виде ПОКАЗАНО В этом ФИЛЬМЕ. А что касается этого демона. С развитием эры электронных сигарет ЭТА ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ становится СТРАШНЫМ ОРУЖИЕМ МЕСТИ в руках ДЬЯВОЛА против человека. Дело в том что в них можно устанавливать небольшое взрывное устройство. И тогда одна затяжка приведёт к тому что лицо человека станет похожем на лицо чудовища из фильма хищник когда он в конце снял свою маску. И ВОТ как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это. НО ЭТО очень «тонкие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.

Да и ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, УНЫНИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ, РАССЕЯННОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ, но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.

А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.

И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.

Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет ""БОРОТЬСЯ"" СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕВИДИМОГО),через СЫНА БОГА СЛОВО(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА. 

А ЧТОБЫ  ""ПРИЙТИ"" к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  

Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ осталось очень МАЛО, ВОЗМОЖНО даже примерно 7 месяцев, И ВСЁ(смотри СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ от МАТФЕЯ, ГЛ. 24)) СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ ""шагом"" будет (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻",True

米戦略爆弾調査は 1946年7月
トルーマン大統領に 
｢日本の戦争終結努力｣と題する報告を提出した
日本指導部との面接調査を基にしたこの報告は 単なる 流言とされていた降伏の打診が 
かなり早い時点から しばしば行われていたことを確認している
同報告によれば 1944年2月には 日本指導部の多くが この戦争には勝てないと判断し 妥協による和平努力を主張している しかも この｢妥協による和平｣は日本の戦前の地位を引き上げようというものではなかった むしろ 高木惣吉海軍少将は 日本は朝鮮と台湾の放棄を前提にして 交渉すべきであると主張していたのだ

1945年2月には早くも 和平打診に関する情報がアメリカの新聞で報道されている
当時 この提案は 公式に無視 ないしは否定されたが ようやく その事実を裏付ける 証拠が出てきた 3月には日本政府が和平交渉の可能性を模索していたことは事実だ 交渉は中国を仲介者とし 1931年以前の国境線を基礎にするものだった そして 同年5月までに駐ソ連日本大使は ｢結果がいかなるものであれ 『戦前の条件より後退したものであっても』それを前提に可能な和平提案を協議するよう訓令を受けている これほど早い時期に 日本政府内部で降伏を唱える人々が影響力を持ち始めていたことを 米戦略爆撃調査報告は確認しているのだ 同報告によれば
｢天皇、枢密院議長、首相、外相、海相は 1945年5月に 連合国の条件による敗戦を受け入れることになっても 戦争は終結させなければならないとの結論に達していた｣
いまや政府内部の主導権を握った和平派は こうした大きな支持を得て この月のうちに具体的な行動を起こした
すでに見たように モスクワ駐在日本大使は交渉打診の訓令を受けていた
そして 近衛公を交渉のためモスクワに送ることも計画された できれば無条件降伏より緩い条件を期待してはいたが いずれにしても 和平のための交渉だった

The movie is NOT about the atomic bomb, but whether Oppenheimer was a communist or not, and all the courtroom trials he had to face. Here the deceiving trailer shows you action, special effects, the preparation for the bomb, electrons and particles swirling around etc. I fell for it, well it's PURE DECEPTION because you will watch very little of these scenes. For ALMOST ALL of the movie duration you'll be watching boring prosecution rooms records, black and white footage - the movie is certainly not all in color as in the trailer... - and endless political debates about Oppenheimer's communist and union affiliations. All of this takes more than 2 hours of the 3 hours of movie duration, while here the courtroom scenes lasts just 5 seconds over the 3 minutes of the trailer (you can count them, they are at the end..), that's why EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS DECEPTION! It is the MOST OVERRATED MOVIE of the recent years. The fact that it won so many Academy Awards it's because it flirts with a prevailing Hollywood narrative that champions leftist views while casting the government and the military in a negative light. The movie glorifies a communist sympathizer who was reluctant to see his creation used for destructive purposes, but was forced to by the military and the power authorities. Left is the hero, right and government are the evil incarnate, Hollywood can't resist but acclaim all that, magnanimously doling out awards after awards like peanuts, more for political solidarity than cinematic merit.

@user-mz7dv4ys6c,2024-03-30T00:49:55Z,2,"I am Japanese.
I went to see this movie as soon as it was finally released in Japan.
I am a fan of director Christopher Nolan, and I was very interested in this movie because it is about the atomic bombing.
In conclusion, I thought this was a film worth seeing.
There are some scenes that affirm the atomic bombing, such as the city of Los Alamos celebrating after the bombing. (Well, I think it is natural for people to celebrate the bombing, considering what was happening at the time. It would be strange if they didn't.)
On the other hand, the film depicted the process of making the A-bomb, the experiments, and the selection of the drop site, which could never be depicted in Japan, and above all, Oppenheimer's anguish and regret over having created such a terrible thing were very interesting.
Despite this, some viewers see this film as glorifying the atomic bomb, but I don't know why they would think so.
What if Japan and the U.S. were in opposite positions? What if they had chosen not to use the atomic bombs?
Regarding the former, I think Japan would have used the A-bomb on the U.S. Regarding the latter, mainland Japan would have been the battlefield, my ancestors would have died, and I might not be here today.
As long as we cannot look into another world line, this is neither the best nor the worst outcome.
Whether it is good or bad, I personally think that it was an unavoidable choice considering what was happening at the time, and I believe that this choice is the reason we are here today.
Please note that this is the opinion of me, a tiny Japanese person, and not of other Japanese people, people in Hiroshima or Nagasaki, people related to the Hibakusha, or the Hibakusha themselves.

Finally, Einstein alone had a different aura about him, and even though he did not make many appearances, I got excited every time he came out.
Without Einstein, the atomic bomb might never have been created. But Einstein is also popular in Japan as a synonym for scientific genius.

@susume7061,2024-03-19T12:37:35Z,0,"For me this movie is about ""capitalism against communism"". That is the main topic and pushes the characters to the background in my opinion. All this interviews, suspicions, no. Watched the first half and heard the second is not different. There was a time, when after WWII the cold war forced the people to figure out these concepts and to decide where they stand because these concepts where connected to rivalling states, the US and the USSR. Growing up the cold war perhaps gave me a sense of underlying danger of potential war, but I didn´t connect it to the concepts. Seeing the communist states collaps in the 80´s and hearing people who suffered from oppression during that time made it impossible to think this is a good idea. Thankfully I live in a social democracy, where the state is obliged to take care, that the gap between rich en poor doesn´t get too big and to help the people who need help. If someone gives freely, good. For their karma too. The generation before me thaught me to have respect for myself and for others, being humanistic and spiritual, respecting nature and taking on the responsibility to try to be a good human. I was allowed to learn, think and develop taste. Taste differs, humans differ. The topic of this movie just doesn´t interest me a lot. It´s okay to think about it, as I keeps coming up in movies like in ""Julie and Julia"" e.g.. The theme of the secret city just came up recently in "" Don´t worry darling"", nicely showing the effects of cutting people off information what causes fear and trouble, which could be one way to interpretate that aspect of the movie. If I want to learn about Oppenheimer, I would rather watch a documentary and if I want to learn about an atomic bomb, I would do the same. This movie just didn´t catch me. Sorry. I know that it was a lot of work to make it.",True

Few people know besides, that the NASA director Wernher von Braun was first a Nazi scientist co-responsible for the deaths of 12 thousand slaves in Nazi-Germany and also of the bombing of England with V2 bombs. I wonder if Hollywood will have the guts of filming about him: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun

I wonder when the Americans will film the atomic bomb from the perspective of the Japanese, the first victims of the atomic bomb, and not from the perspective of ""the father of the atomic bomb"".

Regarding the movie, there seems to be controversy over the fact that it did not depict the damage that occurred in Hiroshima, but I don't think it is necessary to depict it.
This is because the best way to see the actual damage is to come to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and see the actual damage.

●The atomic bomb was not dropped on a battlefield, but on a city where civilians lived, killing 140,000 people.
●Victims included not only Japanese people but also many foreigners.
●When exposed to the atomic bomb, the blood in the body instantly evaporates and expands, causing the skin to sag.
●Even if their lives were saved, some died of leukemia a few years later, or committed suicide because they could not bear the pain of the after-effects.
●The atomic bomb did not serve as a military deterrent, but instead increased the number of nuclear-weapon states in the world.
●Vast areas of land in the United States have been contaminated due to nuclear tests and the effects of westerly winds.

…etc.
There are many things on display that even I, a Japanese person, didn't know about.

Not only was the editing horribly done and confusing, the message of the movie was highly politically biased and is basically propaganda. The movie was way too long and could have been 2 hours. And ofcourse it wouldn't be a Hollywood film if there were no misplaced sex scenes involved. The dropping of the bomb on Japan on none civilian targets was basically genocide and a war crime, but the movie didn't touch upon this subject. Also the movie fail to mention that Admiral Chester Nimitz who was in command of the pacific fleet campaign against Japan, wrote a petition to Harry S Truman personally not to use the bomb as the Japanese were about to surrender anyways. However Japan wanted to surrender to Russia under conditions. USA wanted Japan to surrender to USA unconditionally. The dropping of the bomb was therefore politically motivated and was not necessary. This is a failed opportunity of Nolan to clarify history and make this topic relevant that USA should never have built this bomb and use it and basically committed war crimes while doing so, but instead make it anti communist movie instead. The communist threat that never existed. Vietnam became a moderate country, and China is more capitalist than any western nations. The Soviet Russians became democratic and that worked out of them alot, NOT. Russia under a democracy became more military aggressive than during the Soviets communist era.

I've been to the Hiroshima museum and also Nagasaki (Hiroshima has the better one). Everyone should see this. Civilians died in the most cruel ways. women, children. This is the worst way to die, from radioactivity. The body is already dead, but the person is still walking. Maggots in the body, internal bleeding, vomiting, slow organ failure, etc. Then disabled children were born after the war, or children died of leukemia. Americans sent their doctors who constantly examined everything like a human experiment. Yes, that went down in history. I repeat: This was truly the greatest war crime in human history.",True

Cillian Murphy was great, as were the other cast members, especially the actor who played Edward Teller, father of the Hydrogen bomb, and Gary Oldman playing President Truman.  Although just a cameo role, Gary Oldman plays the  President as well as he did with Winston Churchill in The Darkest Hour. My favorite scene was when Oppenheimer met Truman at the White House, saying he, Oppenheimer, had blood on his hands following the A bomb attacks. Truman was, to put it mildly, not pleased at all about this, saying  he was the one with blood on his hands, as he was the one who authorized the attacks, NOT Oppenheimer.  To quote from the film Truman says “Do you think people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki give a s- about who built the bomb? They care who dropped it. I did. Hiroshima is not about YOU.”
This meeting between Truman and Oppenheimer really did happen and Truman was indeed angry about what Oppenheimer had said.",True

@sasanvideoprod.6548,2023-08-21T23:45:14Z,0,"Don't believe what  Christopher Nolan says.
""On Oppenheimer film""

 Thus, Universal and Christopher Nolan excluded over 80% of the film’s vfx crew from the credits. Why? Who knows. It certainly wasn’t a running time issue. At three hours in length, an additional 10 seconds of credits wouldn’t have made a bit of difference to the audience. But it would have meant the world to the workers who could have had a screen credit on a blockbuster film. (It’s telling that many of the workers who were left out of the credits worked at one of DNEG’s facilities in India.)

Not crediting the vfx crew is actually fairly common practice in Hollywood, and because vfx artists aren’t unionized, there is no recourse for the worker and no penalty for the studio when credits are omitted or misrepresented.

In a day and age when literally everyone connected to a film production gets a credit, from craft services to on-set teachers of child actors to random “production babies” who didn’t even work on a film, it is utterly incomprehensible that vfx artists, whose work makes possible the final images that appear onscreen, are routinely omitted from screen credits.

Oppenheimer is yet another example of how live-action filmmakers like Nolan denigrate and misrepresent the work of vfx workers to the media, and then add insult to injury by not even acknowledging them in the credits. The fact that over 125 people who contributed to Oppenheimer’s success aren’t listed in the credits is a reminder of how the vfx industry is a corrupt and broken enterprise that undermines and disrespects its workers at every juncture.

This piece was updated on July 25 with additional information from DNEG about the use of vfx in the film.

@dpersonal1,2023-07-31T14:09:17Z,1,"The movie is 6/10 and unnecessarily long. I regret going into the theater to watch it, should have just waited for it to come out on streaming services. Unlike Inception, the movie is based on a pretty straightforward plot and storyline, but Nolan had to make it more convoluted than it needed to be. I feel the movie could easily be trimmed to 2 hours and still deliver the same effects/results. 
The number of characters in the movie are also unnecessarily huge and hard to remember. Nolan failed to demonstrate the importance of many characters in my opinion. They are just there. 
There are also a lot of the scenes not really tied together. For example, in the first 10 mins of the movie, it keeps showing Oppenheimer throwing glasses into the coroner and seeing molecules movement, Nolan didn’t really built those scenes into anything significant. I assume those are just used to show Oppenheimer’s intelligence, but the whole scenes feel chaotic and messy.",True

@Jah-Love,2023-07-30T16:00:56Z,0,Knowing how the minds of Babylonian white boys (the principle ones ruling over us) work – and how they pulled a fast one on the world by releasing the movie Contagion in 2011 as a prelude to what they planned on doing in the future (in 2019) by releasing the Covid-19 virus – one must realize that this new movie Oppenheimer has very likely been made for the same reason – meaning – as an indication of their future plans to drop another virus bomb upon the planet. The fact is that these boys aren’t really that interested in making movies based on past history. And although they’ll used events that took place in the past to make a movie – but that’s just to use such serve as a cover for what they plan on doing or are actually presently already doing. The fact is – that about 8 years before they dropped the covid-19 virus bomb on the planet – they made a movie not only about what they planned to do – but in the movie they even gave the area of the world regarding where they’d drop the virus bomb – meaning in China (see movie trailer - Contagion). However their first attempt (by way of the Covid-19 bomb) to eradicate most of us off the planet didn’t happen as they’d hoped – but one thing I know about Babylonian white boys – they have not changed their minds or their plans to kill us all off – and so the Covid-19 or some similar type of virus will be used by them again against us – just wait and see.,True

Dialogue is an essential component of film, and audiences are trained to pay attention to it above all else.

Drowning out the dialogue gives us the sense we're missing something important, making it impossible to focus on anything else.  Apparently Nolan, thinks are too stupid to understand dialogue.",True

@peterfreiling6963,2023-07-28T20:08:49Z,2,"I think this film is misleading.  The atomic bomb did not end WW II.  When it was dropped in August, 1945, Germany had already surrendered.  Also, at that time, the Japanese situation was absolutely hopeless, for the following reasons

-- That Japan had lost surrounding islands, including Okinawa

-- That Japan had lost most of its navy and airforce

-- That Japan had lost hundreds of thousands of troops

-- That much of Japan's industrial capability had been destroyed

-- That many large cities had been destroyed

-- That the war in Europe was already over, freeing up Allied resouces for Asia

-- That Russia had just declared war on Japan on August 7, 1945

-- That Russia had 20 million soldiers, and was sending them East by the thousands

Even at the start of the war, the US had the capacity to produce 10x as much steel as Japan.  By August, 1945 it must have been over 100x, with similar stats for oil.  Given how hopeless the situation was, it was likely Japan would have surrendered in short order even without the bomb or an invastion. So, any attempt to justify the ""frying"" of Japanese civilians and school children with the most horrific weapon of mass destruction ever invented is indefensible.  And, I do not believe that Oppenheimer advocated this.  Please refer to the 1981 documentary, ""The Day After Trinity,"" which includes an actual interview with Robert's brother Frank (founder of the SF Exploratorium).  

So, I do not know why they had to make this film, and I certainly do not agree that Mr. Oceans 21 and Mary Poppins deserve Academy Awards.",True

But every once in a while there comes a film like Oppenheimer and you see exactly what Scorsese meant when he referred to these films like amusement parks . They're fun but largely forgettable

Oppenheimer is the complete opposite - miles and miles ahead of anything that these films could hope to achieve . Every now and then during the movie a part of my mind as an avid movie goer kept saying that this witnessing film history in the making . I was reminded of Scorseses quote that despite a lifetime of watching film we've just seen what cinema could do

In its 3 hour run time there isn't a single frame wasted or.a single character that feels wasted. The acting roster feels like you're seeing the Classic XI coming out to play . The right combination of popularity and acting prowess

I was very happy to see Jason Clarke , Matthew Modine and even Gary Oldman in this .

Robert Downey Jr. Once again proves why he's a living legend and shows us fully the man beyond Iron Man

And as for the man himself - I have no doubts that Cillian Murphy is going to walk away with dozens of nominations and is the first serious contender for this years Best Actor Oscar . A lot of us film nerds have been rooting for him for a long time and were happy to see the man's stellar turn as the iconic Thomas Shelby and now with his portrayal of Oppie he takes that bar of excellence even further. I was reminded of the intensity of classic golden age Hollywood actors time and time again 

Very few directors have made me feel strongly about cinema- Stanley Kubrick , Martin Scorsese , Paul Thomas Anderson and Nolan

Saw the movie yesterday, it was soo good. Loved how intense it was and it has you on edge at some parts. I loved how they portrait the guilt that Oppenheimer had. This movie can also terrify u cause back then they didn't know what kind of impact all this would make and now we have to live with it. And now I'm gonna watch all the content there is on Oppenheimer on YouTube :)",True

More than 20 years before that, most white people undoubtedly didn't think colored races were equal to them. Those bombs were originally the product of racism. Even today, many American still justify the use of those bombs. But they can not explain why they had to use EVEN THE SECOND atom bomb.",True

Any politician, any military general, any human being I think should understand this story, the consequences of with which we still live with today and which perhaps with renewed fear since the end of the Cold War in the late eighties with the recent geopolitical realities as of late. What can I say. It is 3 hours of sometimes clunky dialogue, sometimes difficult to hear conversations, but also of awe-inspiring, moving, horrifying images, of nightmarish dread and angst and guilt, of suggestions of death on such a massive scale that it dwarfs the mind. Do not watch the movie if you are already feeling down, I think: I left the theater a shell of myself, haunted and seared, burned in a way, by what I had just seen. It is such cinematic power and strength, such visual poetry, and such a nightmare that will leave marks on you. The scene where Oppenheimer announced to his fellow Manhattan Project members that they successfully deployed the bomb over Hiroshima. The scene where they are casually choosing which cities to bomb. The entire ending sequence. Pure horror, pure visceral body-gut-reaction -sick-to-my-stomach dread and despair. It was such a PHYSICAL movie. It succeeded in so many ways of not just telling us things, but really making us SEE them, FEEL them, EXPERIENCE them. Not a perfect movie, has some flaws, but overall a masterstroke of anti-war, existential nightmare filmmaking. Wow. Bravo, Nolan.",True

There's this one sick line where he's like, ""I've got blood on my hands."" He created something hella awful that ended up snuffing out the lives of over two hundred thousand people in Fukushima and Nagasaki. In the movie, it's clear as day that Oppenheimer can't revel in being called the ""father of the nuclear bomb"" or bask in his fame.

Who cares?  I was in a coma.  I am there  to see a movie about The Bomb and how it was made—with all the details right from the beginning when the atom was split by Ernest Rutherford.  Instead I got Robert Strauss. Who he—a figure lost to history.

It's a tale spun by the industrial ruling class, a narrative that paints the creators of the most devastating weapon in human history as heroes. But let's not forget, these are the same minds that have brought us to the brink of self-destruction, the same minds that have poisoned the Navajo Nation with their unending radioactive spill.

The industrial ruling class and their nuclear energy tell us a story of progress and power, but what they don't tell us is the cost.

@mrsrjlupin3650,2023-07-19T14:39:33Z,0,"Oppenheimer's parents pushed for him to get to the Cavendish laboratory at Cambridge in about 1924 and the pushiness and some money got him a place.  When he and his mother docked at Southampton he saw two people kissing and took the man's place and tried to kiss the woman.  Then he dropped a suitcase on her head.  When he got to Cambridge he was told he had to make his own equipment for the particle physics experimental work he was doing under Rutherford, which he hated because it was too hard for him to do, and was taken to task about it by Patrick Blackett.  Oppenheimer went on holiday with a friend to France and confessed he left a poisoned apple on Blackett's desk!  Rutherford had to contct his parents and between them got Oppenheimer psychiatric treatment

Also while in Cambridge his mother set him up with a ""suitable"" woman to lose his virginity to, and harangued them outside the door during the act

That's how Oppenheimer knew about the extensive British research being done because of Rutherford and the Cavendish, far further on than anything Berkeley had at the time.

So because of this, Roosevelt got in MAUD and Tube Alloys, with Chadwick, Cockcroft and Walton, Blaxkett and Thomson, told Churchill it was for collaboration purposea and then shut the British out.  So America only has itself to blame for Fuchs

Generation Z and other Pre-Boomers are impatient movie viewers and have become historically torpid. No curiosity. No way will they sit through such history on a level of 3-hour tedium. They prefer to watch a movie such as pink BARBIE. 

My prediction? Oppenheimer will make lots of money the first week or two - encouraged by the many positive, GLOWING (ha, ha) reviews written by liberal critics. But then, as word gets out, the movie will BOMB in most theaters.

Yes it's true that lots if not most CGI looks crappy, and really give a weightless and artificial feel...
But it's also true that a lot of it have worked and looked great, and hadn't been possible without CGI.

Sure a lot of CGI is scourge, but it deserves cred for when it looks great - the problem is that usually when you're watching great CGI you don't know it's CGI.

Nolan used CGI to great effect in Interstellar with the black hole did he not? I thought that might have healed him from his Quentinitis.

@thomasciarlariello3228,2023-07-10T15:32:12Z,1,"There are a lot of forgotten inventions of 1938 to 1945 since they dreamed of cosmic rays focused on  radium powered reactors having conical rooftop Van Dee Graaf generators with stacked cyclotrons while old patents and Riken reports go unnoticed.

Were motorized boxes lowered from ceilings of 1938 to 1945 Manchurian aerospace factories just composite fiber braiders but what about extensive ductwork in background?

O.S.S. Reports show early 1940s Hamgyong Province factories had rooftop hangars for airships and rocket powered gliders since Imperial Japan lacked enough quality ferrous iron too brittle soft of  too much silicate carbon to not be able to construct rail transit tracks nor locomotives amid surpluses of chemicals and silk given Roosevelt's Blockades.  

Hasegawa's memoirs of early 1940s Hamgyong Province described deuterium fuels for Project NA thru NZ and late 1930s patents for extraction of deuterium credit Fritz of Hansgirg of Hamgyong Province to consider how O.S.S files describe how WWII Allied Naval intelligence tortured Fritz Hansgirg. 

Therefore by invite only of March 2019 I gave an MIT engineering conference presentation on how  Noguchi and Songsu of Early 1940s Hamgyong Province worked on a rocket plane engine comprised of a Dewar of cryogenic liquefied deuterium fuel connected to a beryllium alloy reaction chamber nozzle coiled in around electromagnet coils where by cryogenic fuel prevented exceeding Curie Point to lens cosmic rays while alpha particles were deflected for neutrons for neutrons to enrich fuel .  
  
Matter in fact Sakharov's work on muon catalyzed fusion began after Soviet pillaging during fall of 1945 so Alvarez's muon catalyzed fusion began during the 1960s after United Nations Peacekeeper returned from ruins of Hamgyong while Russians tested a lifting body spacecraft with a retractable cone on top. 

Noguchi's Nitchitsu facilities in of Hamgyong province also had Cyclotrons modified for free electron x-ray laser optical traps and xenon argon Rydberg optical pump electrolyzers to refine metals and chemicals before Maiman's first crude ruby laser.",True

@aniketmirajkar9993,2023-07-09T14:35:56Z,0,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" - Oppenheimer
Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the Bhagavad Gita (XI,12):
divi sūryasahasrasya bhavedyugapadutthitā
yadi bhāḥ sadṛṥī sā syādbhāsastasya mahātmanaḥ

""If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky,
that would be like the splendor of the mighty one"".[119]

Years later he said that another verse had also entered his head at that time: ""kālo'smi lokakṣayakṛtpravṛddho lokānsamāhartumiha pravṛttaḥ"" (XI,32),[120] which he translated as ""I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""[note 2] In 1965, when he was persuaded to quote again for a television broadcast, he said:

We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""

@andykaufman7620,2023-06-22T04:36:23Z,2,"I think the Outrage Mob, aka Leftists, aka average person who lives in Los Angeles or New York City today would hate and not approve of calling a bomb Fat Man, or maybe they would because it is a male, and they are anti-Male, but if it were called Fat Lady they would demand a name change for not upholding Body Positivity. 

The other is called Little Man. Again, as they are anti-male they would be ok with this but would demand a name change like Stature Challenged as the term Little is offensive to them. Honestly, today they would or should make a Fat Woman and Little Woman H-bombs 'for Equity' and yes these both must be people of color and other marginalized groups, but knowing how the State department and military operate today they would love that suggestion. 

Yet, they would use updated current year terms like 'Plus Sized Woman' and ""Vertically Declined Woman' for the names. Then a public relations campaign to promote using Lizzo and Ariana Grande for the Spokes Person for this campaign, even though both are woman, and you would think they should use Spokes Woman, but nope, the term Woman is not 'inclusive' and thus even though they are both literally biological woman, they would use the term Spokes Person. 

Eventually the term Person will become offensive in the future when Artificial Intelligence is more of a thing and they will say 'what is a Person' just like they do with Tanswoman today. Yes, that will become a real thing in the future and you are reading prophetic words right now so one day think back 'wow I read that way back years ago and now that is a real thing'. Then they will use a term like Spokes Being. or Spokes Entity.",True

@tehreemtabraiz,2023-05-10T08:35:01Z,0,"Certainly! J. Robert Oppenheimer's life was marked by several controversies, which contributed to his eventual downfall. Here are some of the key controversies associated with him:
1. Political Associations: Oppenheimer's early political affiliations and associations with left-wing organizations during his youth attracted suspicion and scrutiny during the McCarthy era. He had connections with communist sympathizers and was associated with various left-leaning groups. These associations raised concerns about his loyalty and potential security risks, leading to investigations into his background.

2. Loyalty Concerns: Oppenheimer's vocal opposition to the use of nuclear weapons after World War II, combined with his past political associations, raised doubts about his loyalty to the United States. During the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) hearings in 1954, he faced accusations of being a security risk and having communist sympathies. This ultimately led to the revocation of his security clearance.

3. The Oppenheimer Security Hearing: The security hearing conducted by the AEC in 1954 was a highly controversial event that dealt a significant blow to Oppenheimer's career. The hearing aimed to determine whether Oppenheimer's security clearance should be renewed. The proceedings were characterized by tense interrogations and testimonies from various individuals, including fellow scientists and colleagues. Oppenheimer's loyalty, political beliefs, and judgment were scrutinized, and the hearing resulted in the revocation of his security clearance.

4. Ethical Responsibility: Oppenheimer faced criticism for his role in the development of the atomic bomb. Some argued that he should have exercised greater moral and ethical judgment, considering the catastrophic consequences of the weapon. Oppenheimer's own conflicted views on the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons, combined with his involvement in their creation, added to the controversy surrounding his legacy.

5. Postwar Activism: Following his security clearance revocation, Oppenheimer became involved in various activist and political endeavors. He publicly advocated for nuclear arms control, disarmament, and international control of atomic energy. These activities further fueled controversy and polarized opinions about his intentions and loyalties.

It is important to note that the controversies surrounding Oppenheimer were deeply entwined with the political climate of the time and the broader context of the Cold War. These events reflect the heightened tensions, suspicions, and ideological conflicts prevalent during the McCarthy era and the Second Red Scare. Oppenheimer's legacy remains a subject of ongoing debate, as different perspectives continue to shape the narrative surrounding his life and contributions.",True

@jodythomas4324,2023-05-04T23:40:28Z,0,"Love Nolan for the most part, a few of his films took a few viewing to really appreciate, like Memento and Interstellar, others you love right away like The Dark Knight and Dunkirk and some I still can’t get behind, like Tenet, which I don’t hate but I’ve only seen twice and still have felt pretty unsatisfied after both viewings but who knows, time does wonders for many things.

That being said, Oppenheimer looks very promising, it looks like it has that classic “Rolex Nolan” look as I’ve heard it been described lol makes sense very crisp and sharp imagery, precise yet still naturally gorgeous shots. I just hope it’s more of a straight forward narrative, I don’t mean I want to be spoon fed or anything, I just want someone who is not only real but incredibly important to history, Oppenheimer and his associates, to be taken seriously and not have to dig through layers just for the sake of it and instead focus on the story at hand.

Again, I trust Nolan and enjoy his films for the most part, I just don’t want it to be bouncing around to the degree as his more recent films is all, specifically Tenet. I’m sure it won’t be anywhere near as incomprehensible as Tenet seems to be at times but you just never know. 

Either way, this will be one of the few movies that I’ll be seeing in IMAX when that day comes. Probably will be an awards contender too, this and Killers of the Flower Moon seem to be getting all the early press so far, most likely for good reason. I can’t wait for Cannes this month and what the early reactions, my guy tells me Scorsese runs away with it this year for ‘Killers’ he’s old but a legend and they’ve awarded him in the past yes but not since Taxi Driver did he come away with the top prize. I think the mixture of the subject matter in the film, the historical significance, as well as Martin Scorsese finally getting his two “muses” together for lack of a better term for what is almost assuredly going to be one of his final 2-3 movies ever. A wonderful way to end on a high note, this and The Irishman will both be seen as two career greats when it’s all said and done. The Irishman had flaws yes, but it ultimately is one of the greatest gangster films of all time and I would say Scorseses best gangster film after Goodfellas, and a top 6-7 all time for him personally. I don’t even mind the  de aging was bad but I understand the criticism of it forsure, it’s just a shame had it been just slightly less terrible in that area then that wouldn’t have been the only reason it got any media coverage, it was a beautiful story told masterfully by DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci and really flipped the genre on its head in a lot of ways that really only Scorsese, someone so closely tied to the genre and subject matter, could do in a way that comes off as genuine and authentic and not cheap and lazily made up garbage, as it’s so easy for mafia/mobster films to end up almost as a parody of themselves, you have to tow the line forsure. 

Sorry for the rant, hopefully someone reads this lol",True

What interests me a lot is that Oppenheimer -- architect of the Bomb that shortened WWII -- was later considered a Security Risk, and lost his Security Clearance until RECENTLY, when it was restored long after he died by Jennifer Granholm at DOE.

Similarly, Alan Turing, the British Intelligence Genius who cracked the Nazi Enigma code -- enabling Britain to learn German plans as soon as they were transmitted within the German Command -- was ostracized after the war as a gay man and threatened with prison.  He died mysteriously while fairly young, possibly by suicide.

Both men, mental giants, made absolutely incalculable efforts toward helping the war effort -- before their nation betrayed them.",True

It sure would be a shame to not know the whole story about how the Perry Expedition and the invasion of Japan by US naval  forces to open up and destroy its culture and in turn destroying its long harmonious  peace at that  time in Japan  after the Shogun wars. 

Then to the eventual use of this Nuclear weapon on Japan 

It would also be a shame  not to know the reason why instead of practicing peace or allowing Russia to end the war in Japan.  That the US warmongers and (at the time very racist young  imperialist power)  have these eggheads focus entirely on building a  weapon of mass destruction and environmental devastation to mankind. A weapon that was already in development by Germany and Russia but not prioritised due to the moral consequences  and  principals  to fight a battle toe to toe with enemies and principals of war. That’s where a certain kind of evil is born one that the great Christian Priest Martin Luther warned all of Europe  about an evil that if allowed to flourish without  principals and moral code would strive to build and bring to reality 
such an  evil weapon only the devil would approve of , one  weapon that was to not help man but to destroy millions to thousands of women men and children  
eviscerating  all souls  .
This evil that only a “soulless “ group of peoples  could and did carry on with this plan testing it on numerous innocent souls in the process in their conquest Marshall Bikini islands . 

Just remember this Japan was already about to surrender and Russia already conquered Germany .
This weapon was not necessary. As a Lutheran Christian this is unacceptable and we have open our arms to all affected by this  evil thirst for power and greed. 
When will they learn that god is the way and power and money will only lead you to more suffering and pain for others. Amen

@moyler1231,2023-03-02T03:18:47Z,1,"“But we have no choice” I love this line. It conveys the attitude and position the world found itself in 1945. Five years of a devastating conflict that had already taken the lives of tens of millions of people, mostly civilians. The Empire of Japan, after so much conflict still refused to surrender to the Allied Powers, rightly giving them cause to use such a weapon against them -  In my opinion. The unacceptable other “choice” was a land invasion of the Japanese home islands, which may very well have caused another million combatant deaths, of both sides.  And that’s not even counting how many Japanese civilians would perish- possibly millions more. It’s not ideal reducing things to numbers, but the Atomic bombings of Japan definitively ended the greatest conflict in history on much more favorable terms than the alternative. So again, “But we have not choice,” gave me chills. The Allies really had no choice, Japan made clear they had no intention of ending the war in the pacific. *Just my opinion*",True

The swelling horns or strings or whatever they are extremely warm and uplifting, which contrasts so strangely but beautifully against the horror of the potential of nuclear weaponry. The imagery is cosmic, big-bang-esque, yet all the dialogue points to the anxiety and dread of such an invention. I love this contrast very much, it creates a strange space we’re we can sort of feel how absurd, miraculous, and horrifying it is for human beings to have reached the threshold of such power. “I don’t know if we can be trusted…” well that’s really the thesis of the whole thing aint it",True

Robert Oppenheimer[note 1] (/ˈɒpənˌhaɪmər/; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist. A professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, Oppenheimer was the wartime head of the Los Alamos Laboratory and is often credited as the ""father of the atomic bomb"" for his role in the Manhattan Project—the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer was among those who observed the Trinity test in New Mexico, where the first atomic bomb was successfully detonated on July 16, 1945. He later remarked that the explosion brought to mind words from the Bhagavad Gita: ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""[2][note 2] In August 1945, the weapons were used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",True

I do kinda hate Oppenheimer unironically, and because he also worked for the US government. A disgusting imperialist empire. But I'm a history enthusiast, so I can't really miss out on this.

And the reformer among many reformer in the education of destruction of the innocent soul.

Horrifier  like Leopold ,Hitler and many more Could have  treasured  him as their sacred for their massacring goal.

Worthless though he was and will be forever in something called GOOD.

Yet the beauty in the  destruction of livings will be worthless if his zealed invention is not used nowaday war upon innocent soul.

For many dead soul he is the inspiration among many and will be
 
But for the brutalised soul the forever indebter of redemption his soul will be for the justices of every innocent soul.

So admire 
Him because he deserves",True

@mickeytakhar7214,2023-01-07T11:13:20Z,0,"Tenet (2020) left many viewers scratching their heads, but Christopher Nolan's latest seems more firmly grounded. As he did in Dunkirk, Nolan revisits the past, this time with a more controversial story. Cillian Murphy plays J Robert Oppenheimer, the US physicist who became known as ""the father of the atomic bomb"" and wrestled with the morality of his work for the rest of his life. Because everything Nolan does is big, this biopic is shot in Imax and features dramatic on-screen explosions set in the desert of New Mexico, where the bomb was tested. Emily Blunt plays Oppenheimer's scientist wife, Kitty, with Florence Pugh as his former love, Matt Damon as the US Army General who led the Manhattan Project that developed the bomb, and Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, who orchestrated government hearings that questioned Oppenheimer's loyalty.

* And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.   (Genesis 2:7)
* And I will put enmity between thee(serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.   (Genesis 3:15)

* The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.   (Isaiah 40:7-8)
* Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.   (Psalm 146:3-4)

Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

A photograph on display at The Bradbury Science Museum shows the first thermonuclear test on October 31, 1952BRADBURY SCIENCE MUSEUM / GETTY IMAGES

As he witnessed the first detonation of a nuclear weapon on July 16, 1945, a piece of Hindu scripture ran through the mind of Robert Oppenheimer: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds”. It is, perhaps, the most well-known line from the Bhagavad-Gita, but also the most misunderstood.

Oppenheimer died at the age of sixty-two in Princeton, New Jersey on February 18, 1967. As wartime head of the Los Alamos Laboratory, the birthplace of the Manhattan Project, he is rightly seen as the “father” of the atomic bomb. “We knew the world would not be the same,” he later recalled. “A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.” Oppenheimer, watching the fireball of the Trinity nuclear test, turned to Hinduism. While he never became a Hindu in the devotional sense, Oppenheimer found it a useful philosophy to structure his life around. ""He was obviously very attracted to this philosophy,” says Rev Dr Stephen Thompson, who holds a PhD in Sanskrit grammar and is currently reading a DPhil at Oxford University on other aspects of the language and Hindu faith. Oppenheimer’s interest in Hinduism was about more than a soundbite, it was a way of making sense of his actions.",True

@ashleyburns6752,2022-12-30T01:30:54Z,1,"I live in China where people celebrate Hiroshima and hate the Japanese to this day and always will. Yet in the West within ten years of the the war ending British and  Americans were friends with Japan/Germany and were buying their cars and other products, and films like this are made and there is regret and guilt over Hiroshima. In comparison Japan still does not aknowledge its war crimes, neither does Turkey during WW1 et. Around the world it also seems many nations still complain about their former colonial masters and seek reparations etc. So the thought has occurred to me that forgiveness and - in the case of Oppenheimer - guilt over past actions are Western/Christian maybe even ''white'' characteristics not shared by other cultures.",True

“They won’t understand it until they’ve used it”

But in 1945 a terror would be unleashed the likes of mankind had never seen before. Destruction and death on a scale most had never dreamt of. This is what we can do, but what will it cost?",True

Malick on the other hand doesn’t really care much for science, he seems more interested in God and Nature and works with a pallet which is free to explore without the conventions of plot.  Much like you go to your Doctor for physical ailments and your Priest for the soul the 2 strive to nurture big themes - I would argue one does better but both are genuinely trying to heal.",True

Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,

Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;

And on the pedestal, these words appear:

My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;

Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare

The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Oppenheimer’s direct contribution to the development of nuclear technology is as much a revolutionary innovation in science as it is a threat to peace, and Oppenheimer was keenly aware of that fact. Oppenheimer is a figure that perhaps best exemplifies the tension between human progress and the moral implications of such weaponry. Oppenheimer didn’t regret being integral to the development of such technology, but any sane man would look at his creation and feel the mitest sort of dread of the possible uses of such a thing, and how that would change the course of history.",True

@alexplotkin3368,2022-12-20T16:26:51Z,0,"People forget that we built the atomic bomb because we couldn't afford to let Hitler get the atomic bomb first. A Nazi Reich with an atomic bomb would have plunged the world into a new dark age.

Robert Oppenheimer, as the son of German Jews, especially appreciated this. Both Robert and Frank Oppenheimer had to get several of their relatives out of Germany after Hitler came to power.

We know from the Alsos mission, an intelligence unit set up by General Leslie Groves, that German physicist Werner Heisenberg and his team weren't close to building a bomb. They didn't have the resources. And Heisenberg made mistakes in his calculations. My understanding is he wasn't a great project manager.

But the Allies didn't know this. 
And history often hangs on tiny chances. 

If the Third Reich had knocked the USSR out of the war in 1941 by taking Moscow  (the Wehrmacht came within 15 miles of the Kremlin in December 1941) this could have released resources that could have been used for a Nazi atomic bomb program. I know this is a historical counterfactual. But it needs to be seriously considered.

I don't buy Werner Heisenberg's self serving argument he wouldn't build a bomb for Hitler. If Albert Speer had had the resources for a serious bomb project, after knocking the USSR out of the war, Heisenberg would have gone forward with it.

If Heisenberg had integrity he would have gone into exile, as noted German writers Berchtold Brecht and Thomas Mann did. Both were German Christians. 

The Allies should have hanged both Heisenberg and Speer. Speer used slave labor for his projects. I don't see Heisenberg being any better.

Oppenheimer is a tragic hero in the end. He would oppose the creation of the 'super bomb' AKA the Hydrogen Bomb on moral grounds that it was a genocidal weapon. This would cost him his security clearance after the war.",True

The hindu, vedic scriptures.

Its so odd and fascinating, that he loved those stories, that basically describe nuclear bombs and war, and he went on to build the first one.
Here is a quote from Bagavad Gita describing the effect of one of the nuclear bombs (think about this book is several thousands of years old):

""... A single projectile
Charged with all the power of the universe
An incandescent column of smoke and flame
As bright as the thousand suns
Rose in all its splendour
A perpendicular explosion
With its billowing smoke clouds 
... the cloud of smoke
Rising after its first explosion
Formed into expanding round circles
Like opening of giant parasols...
... it was an unknown weapon
An iron thunderbolt,
A gigantic messenger of death,
Which reduces to ashes
The entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.
... The corpses were so burned
As to be unrecognisable.
The hair and nails fell out;
... A single projectile
Charged with all the power of the universe
An incandescent column of smoke and flame
As bright as the thousand suns
Rose in all its splendour
A perpendicular explosion
With its billowing smoke clouds 
... the cloud of smoke
Rising after its first explosion
Formed into expanding round circles
Like opening of giant parasols...
... it was an unknown weapon
An iron thunderbolt,
A gigantic messenger of death,
Which reduces to ashes
The entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.
... The corpses were so burned
As to be unrecognisable.
The hair and nails fell out;
Pottery broke without apparent cause
And the birds turned white
After a few hours
All foodstuff was infected.....
..... to escape from this fire
soldiers threw themselves in streams
to wash themselves and their equipment""


I REALLY REALLY hope they show this, at least that they show the copy of scriptures he was always carrying with him wherever he went.
He literally quoted Vishnu in his famous quote
Oppenheimer could even read and speak Sanskrit

Einstein was also fascinated with the Bagavad Gita, he famously said: ""When I read the Bhagavad-Gita and reflect about how God created this universe everything else seems so superfluous.""",True

@JonMartinYXD,2022-12-20T08:19:30Z,0,"This better not leave out the huge role Leo Szilard played in the development of the atomic bomb.  He predicted the potential of a nuclear chain reaction and filed a secret patent on it _five_ years before Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassman discovered nuclear fission.  The letter Einstein sent to FDR that started the Manhattan Project was written by Szilard.  Enrico Fermi said that if building the atomic bomb was just a matter of thinking the whole thing through, Szilard could have done it all by himself.  Szilard also correctly predicted that Stalin would have eyes inside the Manhattan Project and the USSR would make their own bomb if the Allied effort proved successful.",True

You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.         .//////////./",True

We've had innumerable versions of that already. What I want to see is more about what was done to Oppenheimer BY our own government AFTER the completion of the bomb, in the anti-Communist hysteria!  Oppie had numerous lefty associations from long before the war which were viewed with distrust and disdain by reactionaries in government -- and they got more than a little help from the scientific community as well in the form of ""Dr. Doom"" himself, Edward Teller.  This is why my all-time favorite Oppenheimer dramatization is the PBS series starring Sam Waterston from decades ago (check it out if you can find it!)",True

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.

2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

@stephencarniello2409,2022-12-19T16:12:12Z,2,"This trailer got mad Slaughterhouse Five 'Bombs in reverse' vibes from me.

The quote from Slaughterhouse Five ---
It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:

American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France a few German fighter plans flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.

The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody good as new.

When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly so they would never hurt anybody ever again.

The American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. And Hitler turned into a baby, Billy Pilgrim supposed. That wasn't in the movie. Billy was extrapolating. Everybody turned into a baby, and all humanity, without exception, conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve, he supposed.",True

You forgot to mention Leo Szliard, the dude who convinced Albert Einstein to write to President Roosevelt that led to Manhattan. Enrico Fermi, the best nuclear scientist in Europe and creator of the first nuclear reactor that would be the basis of the x10 reactor, the Hungarian physicsts squad of Von Neumann (my opinion the most practical and influential mathematician who ever lived who had done simillar work with computers on the level of Alan Turing) , Teller (father of the hydrogen bomb which Oppenheimer opposed since he favoured for tactical nuclear weapons for battlefields and his young competive rival that threw him under the bus during the mcarthy hearings), Hans Bethe and 47 other German, American British, Hungarian and Canadian Scientists.

And it ends with the clicks from a Geiger Counter, a sound all too familiar to anyone who's seen Chernobyl. The beginning of the Atomic Age.

Japan objected only to surrendering unconditionally and giving up its emperor, but the United States insisted on those terms until after the bombs fell, at which point it allowed Japan to keep its emperor.

I was truly disappointed by Tenet. The concept was portrayed so many times already and just because you are getting it on a big cinema screen the idea isn't gonna be more outstanding and the emotional story with the Woman felt like written in 10 minutes. 

Dunkirks idea was great but you know what makes a poem beautiful ? Pauses and silence. Dunkirk didn't let you breathe and if every scene is filled with action - the action itself loses meaning. His intention probably was to portray it that way but then you need to have a background story. Something that touches you - but nothing.


So I hope Murphy can deliver his best acting in that story because he is one of the best actors out there and I wish him all the success he can get.",True

Hugely talented but media shy and reclusive, picks his projects few and far between. Great to see him headlining a triple A film. The cast on IMDB looks unreal, one of the best ensembles for a few years. I wonder looking at this trailer if the film is going to have a lot of Terence Malick style visual science type scenes like in Tree of life, 2001 Space odyssey and to a lesser extent Interstellar. Those scenes can put a lot of normal viewers off but make for beautiful art especially on IMAX. Will also be strange to see a Nolan film without a twist ending. We already know what happens. This looks to be more a ensemble cast piece along the lines of Lincoln with the acting pulling it off.",True

This means that it’s not tactically functional at all, it just means to wipe out an entire nation and make that part of the world uninhabitable. Adding uranium or other radioactive components, which they also do with shells that mean to take down tanks, should be outlawed.

Other than that, in contaminated areas I think we need to focus on spraying mixtures of led powder and soap over those areas. The led turns to gold and eliminates the radioactivity. Spreading it as a powder increases the reactive surface area, which will help deplete the uranium more quickly.",True

This is a story everyone kind of knows (Manhattan project that created the Atomic Bomb) but not many know in detail. In addition it is a story that affects all mankind and the future of humanity, in the most important and pertinent way possible; even now every single one of us is just one tiny mistake away from nuclear annihilation. This is a great biopic of a man who deserves to be known by everyone. Even if you oppose nuclear weapons, you cannot be utterly floored by their very majestic and terrible power. And you cannot deny Oppenheimer's brilliance or morality.

There was a movie about it in the 60's, but with current motion picture's tech and budget you have, I believe it would be much much better. Chris Nolan would be great choice to direct it since he mastered WWII movies (Dunkirk, This, etc). You could see Jeremy Clarkson's documentary about the event to inspire the writers on how to tell the story in most cinematic and passionate way. I know you can do this.

Since I am comming to that Holy roome,
Where, with thy Quire of Saints for evermore,
I shall be made thy Musique; As I come
I tune the Instrument here at the dore,
And what I must doe then, thinke here before.

Whilst my Physitians by their love are growne
Cosmographers, and I their Mapp, who lie
Flat on this bed, that by them may be showne
That this is my South-west discoverie 
Per fretum febris, by these streights to die,

I joy, that in these straits, I see my West;
For, though theire currants yeeld return to none,
What shall my West hurt me? As West and East
In all flatt Maps (and I am one) are one,
So death doth touch the Resurrection.

Is the Pacifique Sea my home? Or are
The Easterne riches? Is Jerusalem?
Anyan, and Magellan, and Gibraltare,
All streights, and none but streights, are ways to them,
Whether where Japhet dwelt, or Cham, or Sem.

We thinke that Paradise and Calvarie,
Christ's Crosse, and Adam's tree, stood in one place;
Looke Lord, and find both Adams met in me;
As the first Adams sweat surrounds my face,
May the last Adams blood my soule embrace.

So, in his purple wrapp'd receive mee Lord,
By these his thornes give me his other Crowne;
And as to other soules I preach'd thy word,
Be this my Text, my Sermon to mine owne,
Therefore that he may raise the Lord throws down.",True

But he also said in X-Men Days of Future Past in his words Behold the world will never be the same again. The creation of the atomic bomb and the creation of the nuclear bomb became our last line of defense in the events of the enemy pursuing us.

@MoviesWithMatt,2022-12-19T01:52:43Z,2,"Nolan is the same age now as Spielberg when he made Schindler’s List, I believe its time for him to make his iconic ""mature"" film.   

Dunkirk was an experimental film which displayed his incredible skill as a filmmaker but lacked a wider appeal…Tenet was a misstep…But Oppenheimer is a perfect story for Nolan imo... Who could be more suited to tell a story about a physicist than Nolan? In a way that can be both philosophical, but also suspenseful with larger than life visuals. 


Then when you look at the cast as well: Cillian Murphy has been overdue for a shot at a role like this. Robert Downey Jr. must be hungry for a creative challenge after 10 years of playing Iron man. Ludwig Göransson doing score with Hoyte Van Hoytema once again sure to push IMAX boundaries...

Do you really think he would have been put in charge of the entire development of the bomb if he was voicing ANY...ANY...reservations of building it, or crying about ""should we dare ever use it?""  And, placed in charge of the program, do you really think he would have been LEFT in place as head of the program if he was voicing these kinds of regrets and reservations?  Of course not.  This is going to be Hollywood at its absolute worst.  The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki each killed FEWER people than some of the single night carpet bombing missions of Tokyo and the major cities of Japan in 1945.  The Bomb saved probably a million combined casualties, if an invasion of Japan was required.

Mi abuelo, (from Chís - also known as ""Truth or Consequences"" New Mexico) believed he built part of the casing of ""Fat Man"" that dropped 9 August 1945 over Nagasaki. (Naturally, somebody machining metal parts in a shop would NOT know precisely what part they were making for what device, so I feel this was a wild guess.) My father's family immigrated here in 1848. My mother's Andalucian side came in 1619. My mother's indigenous side....well...we've been here a while."" The Manhattan Project and nuclear weapons are in my blood, probably literally.

My father, mama, and I traveled to Hiroshima, Japan in 2007. There, we copacetically met and toured the city with a survivor of the blast. He was an infant when the bomb exploded. I would say it was one of the most profoundly moving things that ever happened to me. I would put it above my own wedding in matters of soul-changing power. It was one of the most brutal and beautiful things I've ever experienced. 

Oppenheimer was absolutely - and horribly - correct.

 -John 3:16
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself on the cross and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends

When Jesus Christ returns, he will take his children home, and hundreds of millions of people will disappear in a brief moment! When you see this event take place, please remember these words, and understand that the Rapture has just taken place! Please remember that the Christians tried to warn you of this coming day, and that God is real, and his name is Jesus Christ!

Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.

""And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."" Revelation 22:12
