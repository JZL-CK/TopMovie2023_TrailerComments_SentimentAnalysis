@Howlingburd19,2024-02-02T21:00:18Z,37,I think it’s very interesting how Minus One got popular. Most movies today get popular because of hype and mass marketing. But Minus One got popular in a more retro (and better) way. Its success was mainly due to word of mouth and how people told other people about just how amazing it is. Movies getting success and becoming popular in this fashion isn't as common as it was in the 20th century and stuff. So it's cool how this movie's popularity was spread in this fashion,True

@Caries9,2023-12-03T09:16:19Z,16,"""In a movie, there is a line, 'Someone's got to do it,' but in Japanese, it's actually, 'Someone's got to draw the short straw.' The phrase 'drawing the short straw' （貧乏くじを引く: Draw a poor lottery)comes from a Japanese proverb, indicating being involved in difficulties or unfortunate situations. Specifically, it expresses encountering bad situations or events and facing undesirable outcomes or impacts. This is often used to describe situations where one feels unlucky.

In essence, 'Someone's got to do it' and 'Someone's got to draw the short straw' have slightly different nuances:

1. 'Someone's got to do it' implies a strong demand or pressure that everyone should fulfill some responsibility or task in a given situation.

2. On the other hand, 'Someone's got to draw the short straw' suggests a sense that someone needs to experience and confront fate or difficulties. It has a somewhat fatalistic tone, pointing to situations where one must deal with unavoidable hardships or challenges.

In short, the former emphasizes a broad sense of responsibility or task-sharing, while the latter sees fate or difficulties as something that individuals must personally face. The phrase captures the idea of Godzilla, who cannot be satisfied or defeated by a sense of duty alone, and those who deliberately choose to confront him.",True

@Gabriel-G.,2023-11-05T23:15:27Z,1,"Honestly, what's the hype with this one?
Yeah, okay, classic Godzilla is back. Let's just forget Shin Godzilla is a thing.
We KNOW what's going to happen. ""Unknown creature"" is Godzilla, who's destroying absolutely everything and is a threat to humanity. Government fights the creature with military equipment and fails. Then they do some research on Godzilla and find its origin, biology-- allat. Then, using this knowledge, they fight Godzilla again and eventually win.
Sure, many things can happen in between that copy-paste structure, but unless they bring in something new to the plot's structure or to Godzilla (like Shin Godzilla, introducing the concept of Godzilla evolving based on the dangers against it), what is there to get excited about aside from the same thing you've already seen in previous films?
Yes, it's cool that Godzilla is a bad guy, given how much he's been depicted as a ""hero"", both in recent and archaic media. However, you can only do so much with Godzilla being a villian, that being, in a nutshell, the destruction Godzilla causes and humanity's desperate attempts to stop it.
So, I'll ask again: _What's so exciting?_

Guess we'll wait and see what the next Japanese reboot's gonna be...",True

@caninekingpin7442,2023-10-21T19:37:42Z,0,"The good graphic destructive action in these movies began with RODAN'S ENTRANCE in the Legendary movie ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"". Only they didn't ride his character properly for the entire movie. After his entrance he was, like, wimped down in one scene after after another until, by the end of the movie, he was portrayed as a TOTAL wimp (I don't like the alpha monster concept, Godzilla's invulnerability being OVER-done, breathing fire to heaven, sending fire out of holes in his body, exploding physically as a nuclear bomb and so forth. Maybe it's just me imagining things, but I thought I saw baby Kong emerge out of a sea of fire in the Skull Island movie). Anyway, according to the way I like these movies done, this would be about the one main sore spot I find about the last 2 Godzilla flicks. Without this particular sore spot of mine, I, personally, being a 60-year-old authority in the knowledge of these movies, would have enjoyed both somewhat more than I did. They were good. But, of course, a serious fan given these new possibilities that modern technology make possible, will chip in with something to say here. It's called advantageous greed.",True

Final wars came out when I was like 4 or something and while I adore the legendary ones, they just don't have the same vibe to them as the Toho ones because they're made by a totally different culture with a totally different context. My aunt took me, and when we got out she said something like ""That was good, but it kind of felt more like a political drama than a godzilla movie"" and I was just like... yeah, that's kinda the point lmao. While godzilla as a hero is obviously fun, it's pretty easy to see that He does his best work as a villain. He was quite literally born for the role of an extinction event with legs and a bad attitude, and it's so cool that this seems to be going in that direction.",True

Given the accomplishments and artistry of the filmmaker, I anticipate  a thoroughly engrossing, cathartic and emotionally resonating movie, with jaw-dropping visual effects. Being a period piece, set after a catastrophic war defeat suffered by Japan, one which culminated in the atomic bombing of two of its cities, I expect a rich narrative. The tagline, ""Survive and Fight"" wasn't used in the trailer for nothing. I think we're going to see some heroism and courageous determination that will compel the audience to cheer for the human characters.",True

Also godzilla final wars godzilla is also the 1954 godzilla and so is the godzilla from godzilla, Mothra, king ghidorah: giant monsters all out attack

While the rest of the godzilla's after are the second godzilla that showed up after the original died in 1954

Godzilla 1984 is the second godzilla, godzilla 1999 is the second godzilla, godzilla from godzilla against mechagodzilla and Tokyo s.o.s is also the second godzilla in their respective continuities",True

@christianarmstrong2022,2023-09-12T19:17:18Z,1,"finally. hopefully they do a very big Godzilla project, spanning preferably dozens of movies, hitting many genres, having continuing storylines.

do Godzilla like you guys did back in the day. but a lot more… hmmm. I’m not saying every movie is about the same plot. but the overall series should have a plot point.

I think the plot point should be “do humans deserve their power”. but that really needs to be held in the hands of someone who understands how to use the symbol of Godzilla in a way that isn’t inherently fascist. I’m beginning to wonder if the brotherhood of humanity gives a fuck about anything more than profits.

shin Godzilla was lit. but it still had this tone of “what humans are doing is okay”. there was a lot of dialogue regarding how the flow of government needed to change, but it didn’t focus enough on human suffering at the hands of incapable fools. godzilla felt more like a scapegoat for the government rather than a divine intervention.

just saying. godzilla is the protector of earth, how it incarnates each film should be a representation of godzillas relationship with humanity, and humanities relationship with earth.",True

It's postwar Japan in the early '50s, you see the destruction of the tram, there looks to be a flash or two of Odo island and both the Masaji and Shinkichi characters, a two shot of what looks like Ogata and Dr. Yamane on the battleship (presumably when the Oxygen Destroyer is deployed) and it seems fairly obvious that the woman in the window towards the beginning is Emiko.  You even see the partially-destroyed Wako building with its still-intact Hattori clock tower, and a flash of what looks a lot like the radio reporters on the observation deck of the doomed Tokyo Tower as it plummets earthward during Godzilla's second attack.  That would make this a momentous and even epochal production.  While several films have retold the original Godzilla story with varying degrees of fidelity (Godzillas '98 & '19, Shin Godzilla) a direct adaptation of Godzilla '54 has never been attempted.  It's been the lifelong impossible dream of many a hardcore Godzilla fan, to say the least.  I try not to get my hopes up about stuff, but if this is what it looks like, it's going to be off-the-Richter-scale awesome.",True

@GeekedOutNeckbeard,2023-09-09T08:41:25Z,0,"I have REAL high hopes for THIS Godzilla movie in particular. Most of the recent movies, Shin included imo, don't really handle the human side properly anymore. It's mostly boredom and running around talking in circles getting kinda nowhere and is pointlessly dragged on to fit w/e runtime they had to appease. THIS movie has it about Godzilla, where we get to SEE Godzilla fully and his destruction all the while jumping between ACTUAL human characters for fucksakes. FINALLY. 

Doesn't seem to go with the new Godzilla trend of showing him for 3seconds then skipping to a random batch of shitty humans that circle jerk politics and then back to him for a few more and then back to boring humans. or the route that the American Monster-Verse Godzilla trend was, show Godzilla appear, then skip EVERY FUCKING FIGHT until the final one, barely show that final fight and just watch Kick-ass survive insane disasters like a Nuke... somehow. Or watch Eleven run through a city while Godzilla battles Ghidora. Yes, I'd love to watch Godzillas ass react to a strike from Ghidora while Eleven runs into a busted building and hides in a fuckin bathtub and 100% I'd love for it to be in slow-mo so I can really capture the feeling of her fear while a dope ass fight was promised to me only to be cucked in the end.

I have a feeling this one is going to be like the OG Godzilla '54. Have all the humans discovering the aftermath of the Atomic bomb, only to find out that a MASSIVE monster is awoken, then we;ll see a good chunk of Godzilla tearing shit up, while he does we'll see humans trying to sruvive his rampage, and we'll actually fucking CARE, then we'll get back to the main man and before we get too bored with his rampage, go to some humans trying to figure out how to handle him. I hope they'll give Godzilla a good amount of screentime. Rather than 5-10 minutes in a 2hr 30mins long runtime of a movie.",True

A monster that is entirely alien in nature, similar to The Thing, could absorb -1 and become Shin. How else could Shin have produced people out of his tail, that's Thing like, also, Shin is constantly adapting or evolving, and the thing does that. If that happened, it could lead into a Godzilla vs. Shin Godzilla scenario. Lets say for instance that -1 had a Godzilla junior, but, when it was revived by Bikini atoll bomb, it became 54, but he didnt destroy Tokyo, you know. He just went away, but, if like shin revived from his frozen state, they could go investigate what would stop it, like trying to find another Godzilla for instance, in the deep sea caves, and like usual, blast it with radioactivity haha. Father vs. Son battle lol. Knowing he might be weaker, Shin might just become the Godzilla from Godzilla in Hell comic. So, 1954 Godzilla vs Shin, who can do all that weirdo transforming haha.

@bigmuscleguy9694,2023-09-07T21:05:23Z,1,"So, a popular misconception going around about this trailer is that Godzilla will bite the train first, and then throw it into another train, the one with the two guys screaming. However, if you stop at around 0:13 you see that the ""train"" looks to have a white upper half with a teal bottom half. The train we actually see Godzilla bite is black.

This strikes me as an intentional move by director Yamazaki to build up suspense and dread by having Godzilla throw a bus, stop the train, have Godzilla notice the train, and have the lead actress notice Godzilla, and finally have Godzilla bite down on the train, most likey with the lead actress escaped because we see her running with the bandaged guy.",True

@ndsntmttr,2023-09-07T05:27:24Z,0,"The united states military is using technology and manpower to protect deviant sadistic pedophiles that are misusing their access to advanced tools to spy on, harass, molest, and rape children.This sometimes follows them into adulthood. Children that are still too young to know that what they are seeing is not normal are being exposed to disgusting deviant content that is forcefully shown to them by hacking their devices. Many victims may not even know they have been targeted by this, because the majority of the actual sexual abuse happens when they are drugged or asleep, the only reason they might know is because the perpetrator may leave behind physical evidence, like bruises, scratches, or semen. If a victim discovers what has happened to them these worms will misuse equipment and manpower to stalk, shame, mock, and generally try to make the lives of the people affected by this as hellish as possible both offline and online. They follow victims in person and try to intimidate or harass them. They generally use different people who act as though they aren't affiliated with each other and don't do anything they can be arrested for at the time of the harassment. They think they can shame and mock their victims into silence because some of what happens is coerced. These are depraved cowards that gather in groups to harass solitary women and children just to protect sexual abusers and rapists.",True

It's well known that Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the possibility of recurrence. As the series progressed, so did Godzilla, changing into a less destructive and more heroic character. Now, this movie seems to be going back to his destructive roots as the wrath of nature since uranium and plutonium the main ingredients for nuclear bombs are both found in nature only to be transformed into a weapon by humans as shown in the Oppenheimer movie.",True

@RoseDillinger90,2023-09-06T20:22:35Z,308,"I love that they kept the original '54 roar. That one in particular had a profound effect that meshed so well with the original movie. The other roars from King Kong vs Godzilla onward sort of deceased his fear factor despite of it being so iconic. And that was the first roar I heard! When I heard him roar for the first time in the 1954 classic, I was really taken a back because it wasn't the roar that I was used to. That one was much darker and terrifying than what I heard previously as a kid. The fact that they only used it when it called for it was a great effect, and it didn't overstay it's welcome. The terror and bone-chilling feeling of that roar combined with the actions of a horrific monster of gargantuan heights makes me think this is definitely trying to go back to Godzilla's roots in the most definitive, authentic way possible. Everything else with the setting, the design, the story; it seems this time Godzilla is going to be dark. Way more darker and sinister than he's ever been. I can't wait for December 1st",True

Speaking of nuked, at 0:37 wonder if that is his breath weapon again or perhaps a third bomb dropped in part of what seems like potential American involvement based on the War Office slide at 0:56.

@Godzilla52,2023-09-06T05:19:12Z,0,"I think Toho's Godzilla movies are generally just more interesting than what Hollywood is doing with the IP mainly because they're more willing to take chances and do different things with the setting and story. The Monsterverse films really just feel like generic blockbusters with paper thin plots and a lack of any real depth or characterization. That isn't to say that Toho films haven't made the same generic Kaiju films in the past, but they at least seem fairly game to giving a filmmaker the ability to make something a bit more outside the box that's more plot and narrative driven if they want to go that way (The Return of Godzilla, Godzilla vs Biollante, Godzilla vs Megaguris, GMK, Shin Godzilla, the second and third entries of the Gamera trilogy etc.)

Hollywood would probably never sign off on a Shin Godzilla style Goji film or one that was a social/political commentary unless a Chris Nolan/Denis Villeneuve type director with a lot of clout got attached to the project. Every other director would be forced make a soulless/generic blockbuster. For example, Shin Godzilla was nominated and won the equivalent of Best Screenplay at the japanese equivalent to Oscars in 2016/17. I cannot imagine a world where Hollywood produces a Godzilla film with that level of auteurship.",True

@user-fu6bi1jv4g,2023-09-06T05:01:07Z,13,"One thing that I noticed in this trailer: Everyone knows that Godzilla is a ‘monster-as-metaphor’ for the nuclear bomb, but it’s not widely known that he was also intended to be a metaphor for the spirits of the fallen soldiers of the Japanese military, who feel that their ultimate sacrifices have been forgotten by the citizens of the Land of the Rising Sun. This is why Godzilla attacks Japan, and not the nation who nuked them at the climax of World War II. In the trailer for this new film, a woman says, “That monster will never forgive us.” This would seem to reflect the ‘monster-as-metaphor-of-the-forgotten-fallen-war-veterans’ approach, in my humble speculation.",True

@JesusChristislove,2023-09-06T03:00:13Z,0,"15 He died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them.
16 So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! 17 This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!
18 And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him. 19 For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people’s sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation. 20 So we are Christ’s ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, “Come back to God!” 21 For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ.",True

IN THE END OF DAYS THERE WILL BE WARS,RUMORS OF WARS,FAMINES,PLAUGES 



please my friends all the pain,suffering and chaos in the world today was foretold in the book of revaltaions 



On September 18 the UN will have an assembly,this assembly will put into place a 7 year peace treaty in order to stop climate change THIS WILL POSSIBLY BE THE 7 YEAR TRIBULATION (70%) 


During this time governments around the world will fall and be taken place by new governments that represent old world empires this includes  BABLYON,PERSIA AND MORE 
(THESE NEW GOVERNMENTS WILL BE CONTROLLED BY THE ANTICHRIST AND WILL LEAD TO A ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT)

In the book these governments are represented as evil beasts the first one is a lion with wings this will represent the new bablyon and a statue of the winged lion has been put infront OF THE UN HEAD QAURTERS IN NYC


With all these signs taking place it is safe to assume the Rapture will happen soon and if your not saved you will be left behind 


In order to be saved you must.  REPENT 
Accept Jesus as your lord and savior and you must believe he rose from the dead 3 days later through the power of God,you must be bapitized and you must follow the ten commandments 
And follow the word of God

Mutating through stages, being 10,000 or whatever feet tall, having a force-field (I.E. as in Planet of the Monsters) and the rest of that. He should just be a giant mutant radioactive firebreathing dinosaur, period, and I'm glad to see that they're finally getting back to basics and returning the character to his roots. No more fucking around. Instead it's Godzilla as he should be, nothing more, nothing less. And I do like the idea of a true classic film about him that doesn't suffer from the qualitative limitations of '50s technology, even if I'm no CGI fan.",True

Also...historically the germans sent by uboat nuclear technology to japan in hopes they may make an atomic bomb themselves with uranium and parts to begin..starters kit if you will...this went along with jet tech germans sent in another uboat...historically a few didn't make it but there may have been some that did...so you could say japan built a bomb or something smaller but nuclear and dropped it on godzilla with one of those jet fighters...and the movie would be 99% accurate still ;)",True

Even though this movie is set before 1954, the sheer terror of Godzilla has always been one of my favorite things about him. I like the monsterverse Godzilla but ive been saying for the longest Godzilla has to go back to his roots, he doesn't always have to help and be the hero. At least i want him to be a feared giant and people running away, its good to have that back and it being set before the original makes it all the better.

Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

@makokx7063,2023-09-05T13:32:10Z,2,"A lot of people debating what the line ""That monster . . . will never forgive us"" is referring to.
In all likelihood this is simply a mistranslation.
The most common meaning of ""許す Yurusu"" is ""to forgive"" but unlike in English it also has the meanings of 
To allow, condone, permit, accept, overlook etc.
In many shows and movies when someone is about to be killed they'll say 許してくれ！ ""Please forgive me"" even if they haven't done anything wrong, which would translate closer to ""please permit me to live!"" or simply ""Spare me!"".
When he says その怪物は許しちゃくれない a better translation would be ""He's not going to stop until all of us are dead""",True

our community have everything only when we control the lower castes people to reduce population then only we become developed nation the excessive population crisis and non implementation of Sterilisation program it need to be implemented from peon to member of parliament by hook or crook in all religions in bharat
Males who are wasting their precious time from age 21 to 32 years just in preparation of various exams are creating trouble by reproducing and every male must write his surname clearly he belongs to which religion and which caste general category Shudra or Obc
This time we all Rajput's and brahmins must unite together call for all Females and males of our community to prevent explosion of population and for resources of india
The corruption is at its peak in bharat all the institution is only indulged in corruption from private to govt sectors the gram panchayat to nagar paalika nagar nigam the mayor of Pune jaipur lucknow takes 10 to 20% commission in any project and these lawyers with police and administration and politicians are make loot with unemployment at its peak in bharat
All bars and benches are under the one community The Rajputs, Jaats Brahmins and kayastha only real rajputs not those backwards lodhs etc
Politicians apart from party making mockery of people they hand in glove with each other across parties and in this bureaucracy, executive and bars and bench are involved
Inside india now the universities just busy in making politicians by making fool to poor and lower class people educated unemployment is on its high I will name the universities Delhi ,awadh, ccs, kanpur, Devi ahilya, jadhavpur ,jaipur, only busy in making politicians by grabbing money from common educated people
This is very ugly face of politics in bharat the politicians and their family members are only getting rich and wealthy while common educated people are continuously suffering in bharat
I will repeatedly raise the issues what all political persons are doing from gram panchayat to parliament of India only nepotism in every field whether legislature executive or judiciary and so called fourth pillar the media and mediahouses running by businesshouses
the politicians with bureaucracy executive and judiciary in high courts and supreme courts are blocked by few people from past 75 years and India is suffering of educated unemployment at its peak",True

@louisborselio8608,2023-09-05T05:41:52Z,0,"Honestly, I think this movie is going to suck. It doesn't have the natural color tones of real life. It has unnatural CGI tint. Outside of Akira Ifukube, NOBODY  knows how or wants to write Godzilla music. Every other person who writes music for Godzilla movies just wants to show off their artistic ability, and have no concern for what fits a movie. Akira composed stuff for what was seen on screen to capture the perfect feeling. Chances are they're going to use some of Mr. Ifukube's material to try to please the hardcore audience like they did it with Shin Godzilla, but it didn't really help. It just felt tacked on as an afterthought. Plus in a world of CGI overuse, it would have been nice to see some suitmation again.",True

,2023-09-05T01:33:33Z,0,"I was sure that it was going to be the sequel to Hideaki Anno's Shin Gojira, this seems to me a carbon copy  of Monsterverse Godzilla. IT seems that TOHO did not give the green light to Hideaki San's sequel. I need to say, not only because I admire his  Evangelion related works, but Shin Gojira was an splendid take on the franchise and it's character. The atmosphere, the urgency and panic, it's the only Godzilla movie that was capable of showing the beauty of destruction, that arguably is the paradigm behind the idea of Godzilla.   movie that I like the most and in my opinion it has no comparison in the franchise, it's as good as it get's o the other sagas. Shin Gojira has everything a great Godzilla movie needs, good actors,  great practical effects and digital effects in fair proportion, great sound and music, a clever, neat, intelligent writing, a genuinely unique monster... The kind of movie that can start serious discussions about very real challenges outside a theater, from the industry itself to the academy, I really mean it. That's it's the magic of cinema. It's sad because Hideaki San came to this world to make that movie. lol I'm getting carried here but Godzilla in the end it's the perfect allegory of the seemingly fictitious, sometimes. however very serious and real threats our planet is enduring right now whichever the causes. A creature that evolves by means of taking advantage of his  inherent  weaknesses to render himself invulnerable, one which at the end in as a last resort before being put down by humans, tries to divide itself into a million gojira.-like humanoids. Very telling. I love that last scene. By no means I'm saying it's a perfect film: perfect things... such illusion has no beauty. But it's final imperfections are hindered as very well managed challenges, It goes beyond the specter, even taking into account it's budget. Pardon my enthusiasm.",True

This Could either Go in 2 ways.

2. Humanity could Fail to defeat Godzilla and Godzilla could wipe out the Entire Population to Extinction. and Now be the Ruler of Earth.

@BaldPerspective,2023-09-04T22:47:04Z,35,"While I am disappointed Toho will, seemingly, not continue forward with Shin Godzilla, I am excitedly looking forward to this.  I was impressed by the teaser, but this has raised my interest significantly more.  This short trailer shows so many things I've always wanted to see in a live-action Godzilla film, from the full-body reflection shot at 0:24, the people on the collapsing building at 0:33, ppl running like ants from Goji at 0:35, Godzilla walking around in the midst of an atom bomb (!!!) as shown at 0:38, a boat being grabbed by Godzilla's arm from under the ocean's surface at 1:02, a different boat being thrown into the city at 1:06, & Godzilla's immediate landfall at 1:16.  The shot at 0:51 is really similar to some of the shots in Godzilla 2014, & thus not original, but it's great to see it in a Japanese Godzilla film.

The VFX & cinematography are just as good as most of the films Hollywood produces.  The musical score in these two trailers are also excellent, & as a musician I am very much looking forward to hear the score for this.  I am also interested if this will be the beginning of Toho's new MonsterVerse, that they announced back in 2018, or so.  If so, it will be interesting to see how, or even if, this Godzilla (or other Godzillas) will go from personifying tragedy & horror, like Shodai-Goji, to being Japan's hero when he fights other kaiju, specifically more malicious ones like Gigan, King Ghidorah, Hedorah, etc. (Will we see new kaiju??  Will he befriend others like Anguirus, Rodan, & Mothra, like he has in the past?  Will any new kaiju be friend, foe, maybe both?).  If Minus-Goji (not sure if they've officially named him that yet, but they should) does become heroic in later entries, it'll make the line at 1:10 (""That monster will never forgive us."") even more cathartic.

As I mentioned before, I am saddened we won't get more Shin Godzilla, because of all the possibility left behind, but this film is absolutely brimming with possibility, which I definitely can't not be excited for.  Regardless, unlike whatever DC, Marvel, Harry Potter, Star Trek, Star Wars, or anything else does reboot-wise, Godzilla reboots are/have been infinitely more interesting & worthwhile to me.  Go, go Godzilla!

Edit: Lmao, I totally forgot to say, but forget Barbenheimer, the ultimate double feature will be Oppenheimer & this ( *Godzenheimer* ); I legit think this & Oppenheimer will make great companion pieces.",True

The original, GMK, and Shin certainly were, but even in this trailer, we're seeing a whole lot of bodies being tossed around like rag dolls. I also could not help but feel like some of the musical had similar beats to Shin Godzilla's theme with the use of those hard violin sounds and the tempo beats in the background.",True

Then, G swims away at the end of Minute 30.  In Minute 31, he rises in a new bay, kicks the livin' bejeepers out of that place for 29 minutes, and swims away.  Then, the grand finale starting at Minute 61, he rises over Tokyo, kicks and swipes and breathes hot to the 129-min marks.  And swims away.  All the human dialog is ""Scream"" and ""Oh no"".

@thesonofmaniscoming1694,2023-09-04T20:39:29Z,0,"""The Son of Man is coming!""  are the words to be heard soon by the whole world from the Arch Angel Micheal during the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ.
The first thing I want you to know, whom ever you might be, is that God loves you.  I don't care what you have done in the past.  I don't care of the mistakes you have made.   The blunders we all have.  He loves you, I want you to understand that.  Millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn.  In just a few moments time, if you believe it, is all God requires, believe it.  Forget about your past.  When they put Jesus in that tomb, they put all of your sins in that tomb as well.  When Jesus walked out of that tomb, He walked out victorious and we came out with Him a new creation in Christ Jesus.
I am going to pray, and I want you to pray with me.  Saying words cannot save you, but if you truly believe in your heart, you will be saved. And I want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart.  And the Holy Spirit will dwell in your heart and you will become a new creation through Jesus Christ. 
Let us pray...

Dear God in Heaven.
I come to you.
I am sorry for my sins and the way I have lived.
The things I have done.
Please forgive me.
Cleanse me.
With your precious blood.
From every sin, I have ever committed.
Right now, with my mouth, I confess, the Lord Jesus.
And in my heart, I believe that Jesus died for me and rose from the dead.
And I accept Jesus Christ, this very moment, as my savior, my redeemer, and I make Him the Lord of my life.
And right now, I am a new creation, I am washed, I am cleansed, I AM SAVED.  
We ask this all in the name of Jesus. Amen.",True

@KorporalNoobs,2023-09-04T18:23:42Z,1,"I think liked the Michael Bay movie when I saw it, but that was just a monster movie with the twist that it was gigantic. Hardly a Godzilla movie.

The resent franchise was cool and all, but it didn't grab me.

I also liked the OGs (with puppets and all) when they came on TV. (surprisingly often during vacation in the Netherlands for some reason)

But these new Japanese ones are actually awesome. The framing in which Godzilla is the center and basically the greater society reacts to him through exemplary character is really cool. And the CGI has the insane scope (quantity a quality in itself etc.) and a dark edge to it, which gives it an unsettling quality.

With directors like Takashi Yamazaki and Shinji Higuchi at the helm.

@FMAChet,2023-09-04T13:35:48Z,1,"""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve"" - Vermont Royster. Such words may have meaning in this film. As well the following quotation.

""That monster will never forgive us"" Such a foreboding line in a what may very well be one of the darkest films in the Godzilla franchise.

Never have I seen a trailer like this since Shin Godzilla's 1st trailer, with the haunting ""Persecution of the Masses"" playing.This trailer heavily emphasizes a scared and wounded Japan, healing from the wounds of WWII, about to face a crisis that will invoke despair.

It's very understandable that the very fear of paranoia of the Atomic bomb takes form of a destructive and very vengeful leviathan of death, which in reality is a allegory of said fear, a god theorized in mythology and legend now a very real nightmare, looks scared and wounded, but with a resolve undeterred and unmeasured anger and hatred.

From what has been shown so far, it looks that because of the war, and apparently the fire bombings of Tokyo, has not only awaken, but inadvertently wounded this deity from it's slumber, invoking it's wrath before a war scarred land and it's people the scars it now carries. Rising from the earth, much like Mothra Vs Godzilla in 1962, this god or devil of vengeance plans to leave unrivaled destruction and endless death in it's wake.

I look forward to see how this film goes.",True

Just cuz Godzilla isnt what he used to be, doesnt make them bad. And these complaints keep saying that Godzilla is ""too good"" but he isnt even a hero. Hes a King thats protecting his territory and establishing dominance. Hes not a protector of humanity. Hes more than willing to wipe them out if they overstep their boundaries like with mechagodzilla. In all honestly, him being a million year old ancient alpha predator was more probable than some marine species turned by radiation into a monster within a few years time. But regardless, cant we all just enjoy both sides of him? Just accept that there are different forms of Godzillas. Liking the OG is not a problem.

So I hope Toho is listening to the fans and bringing us something he have not seen before. I am interested in what he can do rather than cosmetic changes.

Not going to jump for joy like everyone else here.

If this is before the 1954 film then Godzilla is not the king of the monsters. He needs to fight Anguirus in or for that to happen which he does in 1955.

@kaijuar2003,2023-09-04T10:41:59Z,0,"""That monster....will never forgive us.""
I don't know about anyone else, but since the character says that, I THINK this Godzilla KNOWS why he's attacking people and why he's so violent, he has an ACTUAL reason to be this violent towards humanity. He ISN'T like the other incarnations, not like the original Gojira, this Godzilla legitimately has a REAL reason to be this hostile.

And another thing, I also THINK that at the end of the movie, Godzilla WILL find a way to forgive humanity since the character mentions forgiveness.


I'm MOST LIKELY wrong about the forgiveness part, but that one specific line in the trailer REALLY gets me thinking about this particular Godzilla. By the way, just recently on Twitter, I came across a tweet that used Godzilla as a way to convey that nuclear power plants are the safest and best way to gain energy, which Godzilla ISN'T about energy/electricity but nuclear weapons and the destruction they have on humanity and the pkanet as a whole, so yeah, the Twotter users DIDN'T know shit about the message Godzilla is MEANT to convey.

And during the 60s & early 70s, Japan finally was able to change, to forget about war and  it’s horrors, changing Godzilla into a kinder creature even though his birth was from a horrid moment in human history.

The United States, are not willing to villainize themselves, the A and H Bombs are what made Godzilla.  Godzilla is seen as Hubris.  But he’s never seen that way to America, and that’s very sad, it’s disgusting when you realize it in great context and the comparisons between the two Nations.

It’s a damn shame that the 2014 Godzilla film never came close to making Godzilla represent that Darker, personal half.

I want to see Godzilla fighting against other monsters. I was always struck by his courage to fight the ugliest, larger, most evil looking monsters that Toho could send his way. That made him endearing. I do at least like this design the best of all the Reiwa era designs but I have hated pretty much everything Toho has put out with “Godzilla”s name attached since “Shin Godzilla”. Honestly, the definitive Godzilla I loved the most tragically died in 1995. Nothing else Toho, Tristar nor Legendary has offered has come close to that undisputed king of the monsters since.",True

Interesting plot but hence it is 1945 and Japan fights Godzilla with their IJN Forces. I want to see IJN Yamato vs Godzilla even that is for a few scene. Even maybe she be the one who defeat Godzilla but also taking her down in the progress. It would be epic fight NGL. The Largest Kaiju vs The Largest Battleship. A Titan vs A Titan. Imagine that.

Nope. Never. Literally four movies ago:

As long as we continue waging wars over nothing, polluting in every conceivable way, denying or forgetting our atrocities, as long as people care more about power than doing the right thing, as long as a single nuclear weapon remains on this planet, Godzilla is never, ever going away. And there's nothing hollywood or anyone else can do about that.

They could just say it's a new movie from Toho called Minus One, show the destruction, devastation, and the people moments with no images of Godzilla, getting people interested in what is causing the destruction, why an explosion was going off, or what the monster could be, then reveal it in the theater itself.

I get it though, Godzilla is a brand name that will sell and would likely not get as many viewings on initial release if they did that but imagine the shock when you go to a movie with some mystery about it, not realizing it was really going to be a Godzilla movie. Think of it like the first Godzilla movie, where you don't actually see Godzilla until about 20 minutes in and even then, it's only a head shot.",True

Also I notice in the end, we see Godzilla looking as if he is freshly scarred, that scene could take place after he is hit by the bombs and we could see Godzilla injured and flesh wounds all over his body from when the bombs hit him, because those scars at the end of the trailer look real nasty and fresh too as if he was just hit by the atomic bombs. So my guess is first we will see Godzilla in his natural animal state, no scars, flewh wounds or anything like that, then we will get a bombings scene and after we get our first look at Godzilla after his ordeal, seeing his mutations, flesh wounds, and scars all over his body and thats how he will look for the rest of the movie, the wounds will heal up but the bombings will leave him forever changed and scarred up for the rest of the movie.",True

Overall really impressive trailer and promising new film.

a) Godjira looks extremely wounded
b) Some of the wounds seem to be glowing.

I don't ""see"" Godzilla as ever being just ""good"" or ""evil."" He is essentially an allegory for the consequences of mankind's obsession with violence and destruction. I mean, yeah, the U.S. got the whole nuclear armaments thing started, but many countries have nukes now. By possessing such things and creating even more destrucitve weapons, humanity may very well have lost sight of the horrible consequences their actions can cause. Godzilla is like a long-lasting and enduring (fictional) physical reminder that some choices will loom over humanity for many, many years to come: ""You did that, and now you have to live with it.""

@nerdsman567,2023-09-04T06:31:39Z,0,"This gives me very similar vibes to the 2012 Comic-Con trailer for “Godzilla 2014” (Before Legendary Pictures pulled the “Bait and Switch” on everyone). The actual movie we got with G2014 was the absolute BARE MINIMUM of what you could even CALL a Godzilla movie! It seems like this movie will have actual substance to it and actually depict a apocalyptic take on Godzilla, much like what Legendary initially promised with that 2012 trailer, but abandoned it and went for a much more watered down take with G2014 and the rest of the MonsterVerse, which have gradually become overly campy and cartoonish.

Here’s hoping “Minus One” succeeds where G2014 failed in its attempt at making a grounded and serious Godzilla movie (Dull storyline, bland and forgettable human characters, constantly cutting away from the monsters, shrouding the monsters in constant darkness, etc.). Judging from this trailer, it looks like we’ll actually get to see the destruction Godzilla causes, unlike G2014, which constantly cut away to the aftermath. Obviously, it’s too early to judge “Minus One” properly, however, as far as tone and atmosphere goes, THIS movie is what G2014 should have been!",True
