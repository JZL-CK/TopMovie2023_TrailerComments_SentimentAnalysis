@JoshHandler-bu1dt,2024-05-29T22:13:23Z,0,"Have to admit, just saw this.  I love Jeffrey Wright, but just never had desire to see it.  Totally regret, as I've watched it 3x now.  Very well written, well acted, love the stereotypes, innuendos, etc.  I'm not a fan of Ross, but she was very good in her small part and Brown can make a grown man cry.  Wright should of one the Oscar for this, it is one of his best.  Very intelligent, highly recommended.",True

@TwentyFourUsedSocks,2024-03-16T10:19:51Z,0,"You know, there is a documentary that is a duplicate story line of this movie : Its Called : 
CREATED EQUAL: CLARENCE THOMAS IN HIS OWN WORDS
His story is a reflection of the plot of American Fiction, except Clarence Thomas had to live thru the bigotry & rcism of low expectations that the elites in this country fabricated over the years magnified by 100000000000000000000% . If only hollywood had the fortitude to tell the story   of Clarence Thomas except they don’t, because hollywood is the most racist entity in the country against black men especially those stand up for INDIVIDIAL RIGHTS AND BELIEVE THAY ALL MEN ARE CREQTED EQUAL. The events & turmoil that Thomas went thru yield stories that are timeless & valuable to the human experience yet live in a culture that REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE 1 nor tell the stories of one of the greatest Americans to EVER LIVE.   Instead they dance around the issues of race & equality that Thomas faced like pillar of concrete stemming the tide of cultural devolution. Clarence Thomas is one of the most important thinkers in the 20th century & everyone acts like he doesn’t exist & instead creates fictional fragmented mirrors  of his story & parables.

 If you like this movie then you should identify with Clarence Thomas & the experiences he LIVED thru, including some of the important times& events  in American History.
Wake the F up, Learn something new..., If u dont know the story of Clarence Thomas take 90minuts & BE.ENLIGHT3N3D!!!!!!!!! There are black men in America that media and elites try to silence, Clarence Thomas is without a DOUBT one of the most censored, his words & experiences will allow you to understand where he is coming from and why he believes what he does.",True

I have never in my entire life seen behavior as racist as the behavior as those who profess to want to change things. This film exposes just a bit of this insanity. Some wonder why the movie bothered with a serious family drama parallel to the already terrific comedy plot but I think it was showing black people with their real problems. Death, dementia, things we all have to deal with in 2024. I applaud the bravery of everyone involved with this film considering the joke was on the very institutions that produced it. Incidentally the acting was terrific, every scene involving Monk and his agent was HILARIOUS, Sterling Brown who is the reason I watched this film never disappoints.

@dickriggles942,2024-02-10T06:53:58Z,1,"Well written movie but painfully obvious the writer has a trust fund and doesn't know how rich the family in this movie was. Everyone is a professor or a doctor, the lead has had books published in the store. How can they not afford care for their mother in a home? The sister died and had money and assets available to use. I'm sure she had life insurance. Also, the mother had to have resources to use, the house, savings, retirement funds, etc.  They were all one percenters.  It's an insult to people like me and others who don't have good jobs like this. Other people do get their relatives taken care of with low incomes. I might have fallen for this movie in high school, but as an adult? No way.

It's really a shame, some tinkering and this movie would have been believable. I think the writer wrote the story based on his life and didn't understand how regular people live.",True

As much as we would like to think it's not. Consider who has the power to make a guy with a 5th grade education and terrible diction a superstar. Meanwhile, they will try to tear down Black men like Obama. Professors have been saying this for decades. It's actually white people who love to prop up the lowest denominators of the Black community. Violent rap is almost totally consumed by white suburban young men. Black people like rap with a message or party rap(the club and drinks). Anyway, this movie looks clever and will leave a lot of people thinking.",True

This movie is a remake of the premise of 'Bamboozled', a movie made in 2000 by Spike Lee. Many of us were alive when it was made. Yet, every 25 years, this premise comes back around and 'ITS SO ORIGINAL AND WHAT A REVELATION!'. This is the daily life of code switchers, corporate academics and minority intellectuals, and its been the story of our fathers and their fathers before. what makes this movie MOST special, is that it takes an exhausting topic, and takes the exhaustion out of it, because that's the work we have to do over and over again.

@elainegmorrison,2024-01-15T03:20:53Z,1,"It had some interesting ideas, many humorous moments, a good overall concept. I liked it, but wished they upped the pacing. It could have been drop dead hilarious, but it didn't move fast enough for me. A piece of music at 30 mins was beautiful. It clearly satirized itself and circled around eloquently, but they could have played it up as a quick-witted comedy instead of dragging in melodramatic moments. Even the melodrama could have been brought back into comedy. I was worried the earlier snappiness would wane after the sister exited from the scene and it mostly did. That's where and why it needed the rest of the characters to really step up. 
For example, the moving scene could have had the caretaker taking more of the contents, as her fair share, them knowing and looking the other way, because for all it was expected and condoned, but still audacious. Maybe someone else could have died, because they were half of the humour. It could have been an illegitimate member that no one knows very well. The premise was made to be hilarious as the uptown man pretending to be downtown, but it didn't utilize the stress of the downward spiral to its advantage. Why they'd choose him to be a fugitive is beyond me, and it did return when we least expected it, because it had been forgotten. 
But every lie should have tightened the web (yes, I know, tightened the noose, wound the web - and they could have played on the humour of writing stuff like that, as that's what it was all about) and increased the tension until he was in an impossible place. Yet it didn't. Like how was he supposed to collect the money, and where were the repercussions from his scenarios and people identifying with persons depicted, as well as where were the various ploys to keep up the charade? It could have been like a man juggling too many balls until the moment he drops them all. The film cut off and put away each ball shortly after he picked them up, like the women. There was a potential conflict of multiple interests yet there occurred a convenient break before that even happened.",True

Even movies that challenge stereotypes still fall into it over and over again. It’s the voice the people want to hear not the actual voice of the person writing the book. Of course there will be criticism that well this doesn’t represent me but that’s also the point that book is a perspective of that person. It’s also not the authors job to make the book about you it’s their perspective.

@kingofswing3000,2023-11-24T20:47:39Z,1,"True story: not too long ago the biggest star in the world was Will Smith. Along side that, Denzel could take any movie over $100m.  Nobody saw black men. They saw great actors who happened to be black. The state of art today -- in this case, cinema -- and why it's so bad, is the very people who preach against racism only make things based on race, intersectionality and quotas. They rail against stereotypes then create nothing but. If you want great movies, cast for talent. Not quotas. People will pay to see Denzel or Idris in everything. They know they're getting a movie, not a message. So stop with all the identity politics. Just tell stories. Don't preach or teach ideologies. If we go back to a time where we all loved Kirk Lazarus, everything will be right with the world. Also, I know this movie is trying to fight ""the (white) establishment"" profiting off of black stereotypes. Point of fact: the media being created are almost always made by people of color. ""The establishment"" doesn't care what's being done as long as it makes money. Studios will go to a POC and say, ""Make anything you want."" Then that person goes and makes something borderline racist. So stop blaming white people. I've been studying cinema for decades. Just about everything you classify as racist/stereotypical wasn't helmed by anyone white. This was especially true in the early 90s. Studios gave POC money. And they went and made films about street life. And if they did try anything else -- say, Eve's Bayou -- POC didn't pay to see it. So white people were blamed for enforcing stereotypes when it was POC at the helm. Then white people were blamed for POC not getting more opportunities. But they didn't get opportunities, because POC didn't want to see what they made unless it enforced stereotypes like Barbershop or Friday.",True

But I'm also a writer who is EXTREMELY PROUD of her race, and wants others to know our community is about heartache, yet it is also about love, community, and so much more! 

I hope this movie sheds a bright light on what African Americans (and really, ANY underrepresented writer and/or other professional within this industry) face as we navigate these treacherous waters. 

It's AMAZING how I sat (just yesterday) reflecting on why the writing industry is ripe for a Civil Rights movement of its own. I'm ecstatic to be a part of that movement, as my AUTHENTIC self.
