but, one, it is not a film of Oppenheimer's dimension.

He is an actor who has not had the recognition he deserves or roles more in line with his ability.
but to say that this role puts him in competition with that of cillian murphy....
It seems absurd to me.

@CanadaMath,2024-01-13T15:19:51Z,0,"Another boring, depressing affirmative action / diversity / political correctness movie from the ever declining Hollywood.

What a waste of time this was.

Paul Edward Valentine Giamatti is a great actor, but this movie was a snooze fest. Also he is just being himself in this film and does no actual acting.

The overweight black woman Da'Vine Joy Randolph is also just being herself, and does no actual acting. She is just giving the usual ‚Äòbad attitude‚Äô resentful bitter black woman bit.

But alas, she will win every award for her boring, pointless role and expect her to give an amazing acceptance speech at the Academy Awards about how she rose from poverty to win the Oscar.

Did we not learn anything from the Harvard/Claudine Gay scandal? That giving jobs to people solely because of race is a disaster.

But Hollywood has been doing this for years now and I am sick of it.
