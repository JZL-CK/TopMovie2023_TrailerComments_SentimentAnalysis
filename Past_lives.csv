While I was watching it, it felt like a more grounded version of Lost in Translation.   Not that they are the same but they play a few similar notes but this movie is not cluttered with jokes and noise that prevent you from feeling how raw it feels to be painfully in love with someone.",True

@knoxtaurigen,2024-05-26T03:56:21Z,0,"The last scene broke my heart in billions of peaces. I cried a river, specially because: I've got in my own life exactly the same story.
My first love/boyfriend in life, when I was 18: and met again after 20 years, 4 times, being the last time in December of 2022 (when we got extremely drunk in a bar and talked about everything - the difference is that I've got a boyfriend and he's got a fiancé in that particular time - but we met alone)
I can see myself with him in all those scenes (except we've never met each other's partners).
We've got to the conclusion (without saying it) we will never be together again but that we will always love and wish the best for each other wherever, in whichever time of life, we are 🖤.
Seeing him has always been seeing a part of me wandering somewhere else.
Our love has never been dead and never will; we were just not meant to be cause our lives/decisions led us to different paths.",True

@nothingwrongwithu,2024-04-13T16:13:13Z,0,"I want to share my story in case anyone has experienced the same thing, thoughts about this have been quite disturbing my mind for some time now:( I've prayed to Allah and confided in my mother, but I'm still not completely healed, yes I know it will definitely take time, it's just who I know that reading comments from someone here will help my recovery process a little faster <3

This film hits different to me. Since the trailer appeared on the YouTube ad, I immediately felt connected and some time later took the time to watch it. Oh my God, many parts are the same, about chasing rankings, about the existence of ""sparks"" even for elementary school children haha. I remember we were entered into several competitions together by our teacher's request. He once gave me a hair clip haha so cute, and at that time as an elementary school student I I just thought that he was different from other boys, he was a good boy to their parents, when the other boys at that time were quite naughty. He's intelligent, polite, and pretty :) he's shining, but somehow he becomes a ""social enemy"", maybe because he's considered arrogant(?) but he once said that he has a hard time remembering people, is he disliked because he doesn't care about his surroundings? Idk. 

Ok, long story short, we weren't in the same middle school, actually I wanted to go to the same school, but it didn't happen. However, in the end we were in the same high school. There was almost no interaction there as I recall. He was even dating someone else, which I didn't even know about because apparently I was too busy chasing rankings haha, or, again I forgot :) Then we entered the same university, different faculties, he geography, and I engineering. I once met him in the student arena cafeteria, but neither of us greeted each other, just looked at each other. Long story short, I graduated, he hasn't at that time, we joined a badminton group with elementary school friends. This is where the story begins.

We finally connected and were ""on the mend"" again after all this time. We replied each other's WhatsApp stories and one day he expressed his feelings. That he realized there was a loop about me and him. When we were in middle school, we chatted briefly via Facebook (no longer able to be traced because I deleted the account) about the National Examination at that time. The reason he didn't say hello when he was in the arena was because he felt inappropriate because he was a geography student and I was an engineer. 

Actually, this was quite a long process, between him confessing and me knowing the story behind it because he's the type who finds it difficult to tell via text (he said written language is difficult), I really limited from meeting the opposite sex, what's more, he has expressed his feelings to me and it seems like I do too. I have feelings for him :) so I'm afraid that our meeting will be disturbed by Satan (but in meetings between men and women there must be a third person lol). OK, long story short, he gave up, he said ""nothing wrong with u, u r 99% perfect"". This should be a compliment, but it hurts.

He really came with memories that seem to still remember many things at elementary school, about me often taking time off because I was sick (of course I remember this), about me often not having injections with my friends at school because I was afraid, about nickname that were only my mother gave it to me at that time because teachers and friends called me by different name. I feel cared for, I feel special, all this time I have a secret admirer?

We're not dating but I like the way we fight. His replies sometimes irritated me, but made me miss him. So after he gave me a sentence that seemed farewell, I felt like breaking up hahaha. He said it all started in the 3rd grade of elementary school, at that time he had time to move around the area and of course his school too, but only for 1 semester. He asked me to remember how we said goodbye, of course I had forgotten. He concluded that all this time the only one who had feelings was himself. Is that possible? Everyone's memories are different, especially since it was a long time ago. In fact, there is a Javanese proverb that says ""Tresna jalaran saka kulina"" which means love can exist because you are used to it. He didn't seem to respect my feelings because I didn't remember the same things as him. Even though I once told him, when in elementary school, I admired him for all his strengths. I felt suffocated by it. Maybe this is a warning from Allah to cultivate feelings that are not halal. Astaghfirullah.

Looks like he's just playing around, right? Or is he too resigned? Ah, he is very difficult to understand, please convince me to move on immediately and not get stuck in the past which forces my memory to remember what I don't remember. Please convince me that he is not my soulmate. I've explained at length to him (but implicitly because I'm embarrassed as a Muslim woman and can't express my feelings) that I'm interested in him: I made a playlist with a certain genre as he suggested, I found out more about his hobbies, and I came to like a song because he once uploaded it. I even became a detective by finding the coordinates of the house using only the general characteristics it gave, namely that the house now has rice fields in front and beside it. But even he didn't reply to my long message properly. It's like he doesn't care about my feelings, right? Or is he actually hurt, but trying to act normal? Idk, sometimes I think, is this what makes him disliked by his friends?

He said now I just need to think about my work and thesis so it can be finished quickly, but he didn't give a clear conclusion. He closed the book he hadn't finished reading, I couldn't help but wonder. He said he didn't want to be a shadow of my future, but what if it was like this? Recently he still replied to my story about fishing, what is he doing? I immediately attacked with don't make me into a human fish that you hook for fun without bait. Just false hope. Please someone make me aware, I have to work immediately and finish my thesis in the next two days, I don't want to be trapped by that thought. Thank you very much for reading my very long story. Love uuu <3",True
@SparkCroft21,2024-04-13T10:08:21Z,0,"Let me know if I’m the only one that didn’t like that movie & takes love as not only an emotion but a commitment. 

Cuz I’d straight away drop that relationship seeing that my wife is crying for a “regret and emotional turmoil over the missed connection” with another man. 

Better to let her go than live with that feeling that “I’m the reason she can’t be with him”. 

And don’t tell me I didn’t understand the plot. I literally went through a divorce because of a woman that did that to me. I was the “Arthur” that believed it would be okay but it wouldn’t. The movie should continue to show you what will happen next.

Beautiful? Well prepare for a wild “beautiful” ride in your relationship. Though seeing how many emotionally unstable young people we have nowadays it’s not surprising that “THIS is beautiful” to them",True

Each found someone, one went in deep. When they caught up again, this time f2f, she seemed conflicted although rooted in a certain place and partner. It was almost annoying since he was still fraught with deeper feelings than friendship, and a chemistry was obvious. This goodbye however seemed to bring him closure and clarity about her leaning, but to my surprise it apparently broke her heart. The irony - while he watched her cry when they were young, this time around she cried because of him and onto her partner. A well portrayed story! Very well made film! Perfect cast! Perfect lines, and just the right amount of lines; more seemed spoken when no words were there. I personally think Teo Yoo stole the show. Well I'd been through a similar experience. When we met 21 years after high school, how he was confused me. I realized the love was more mine and was quick to change it to friendship that stayed rock solid till he passed 10 years later.",True

It is the nature of feminine which just can not settle down, CHAOS is the need of feminine, women just can't refrain from taking wrong decisions and then wanting shoulders to
cry upon, to get sympathy - it all makes sense now why she choose him over Snape.

Thank you for
	1. Trauma for life
	2. Killing the ability to LOVE and above that the ability to TRUST
	3. Training me to work my ass for some dreams and then see them getting destroyed
	4. Training me to feel powerless all the time - NOTHING is my control
	5. Killing my desire to have a beautiful family
	
All the very best, hope to see you never. 

For those who read so far, here is the summary of movie :

""Such a tragedy for all 3 people. 
For one - it's a missed opportunity... someone you love with your whole being is so close, yet out of reach so you accept defeat. 
For another, accepting that the love of your life could be soulmates with someone else so you accept fate. 
And for her, realization that she chose her career and lifestyle over what could be her one true love, and settling for a man who is good to her that she can't justify uprooting her life - a decision she has to live with. 
And all 3 will be wondering ""what if?"" forever. Beautifully captured.""",True

Do you think that israel dropping a bommb knowing that at least 1 innocent would diie beacause of it, right or wrong ? Do you think israel kicking someone from his home that he was born in it, his great great grand parents were born in it, his memories was in it, his room, his life was in it good or bad ? Do you think that israel destroying schools and universities that students were creating their future in it, or about to get graduated from it good or bad ? Do you think israel destroying hospitals knowing that there is patients inside that can't leave or they would diie good or bad ? Do you think israel seeing and knowing the humilating life that these who survived till now are living without food, clean water, electricity, médecines, anesthetic are living now and it is blocking help to them good or bad ? Do you think that israel imprisoning children (under 18 as you say) for trivial reasons and for unidentified period good or bad ? Do you think that israel stealing the skin and organs of dead plstins without the permission of their family (if any left) good or bad ? Do you think that israel calling plstins human animals that should all be got rid of good or bad ? Do you think israel torturing plstins harrasing, insulting and humiliting them good or bad ?

I'm sorry I didn't have enough courage to ask you out. To tell you how beautiful you were sitting across the macroeconomics class in TCU back in 2001. Our eyes met when we were leaving class and you gave me a wonderful smile. The next day, you sat right next to me in a long dress skirt with your legs exposed almost halfway. I was peeking at your beautiful figure every now and then but didn't have the courage nor the will to push me to say just ""hi, I'm Michael, nice to meet you."" How much our lives would've been different. Perhaps, maybe even the slightest chance our relationship could've blossomed into something special, even marriage later on. 

I still think about you some 23 years later, almost every day. If you ever read this, just know that you have a special place in my heart. Till we meet again, someday, somewhere, be it in this life or the next. Take care.

But as one analyst said, and I agree that's the premise of the entire film, it's about her relationship with her childhood homeland. The Korean merely is representing that homeland. It's not about the boy. It's all about her. She sees part of herself in him. And the white guy is insecure about that part of her which is all her own. It is exemplified by the Koreans chatting amongst themselves as he sits to the side. The truth is the woman wouldn't be either national anymore, so she can't go home. She's somewhere in between, neither here nor there. That's what the men represented. It was really a story about her and some kind of vacillation, not about any romance.",True

then I saw ""The Holdovers"", which is great,
than this one. 
Next on my program is ""American Fiction"".
The list has 10 films. 
Almost all the other 6, I'm not going to watch.
Different reasons. Some maybe even stupid.
LIke ""Killers of the Flower Moon""...legendary Scorsese in action.

@kaungsithu5606,2024-01-08T14:40:01Z,2,"Here is my take on the last scene,

I think I know how she feels then. Just a feet away, there is this person who you want to share many things with ... leaving. You want to share every single detail of what went on in your life since the last time you saw them. You have so many thing in your mind and heart, it is overwhelming you don't even know what to do. 

But here they are, leaving, and you can't stop them even knowing that if you did, they might stay. 

You can see that she has not accepted that he is leaving, you can see it in her eyes that she is not ready to let go of him, but she has already accepted that she has changed and i think that is why she stayed with Arthur.

After meeting him, she had a taste of the answer to the biggest question of her life. What if? ... what if she didn't leave? And sometimes it is hard to accept that no matter how good it could have been, can't happen anymore now that it is too late. 

But we all know what she didn't leave in the first place, this life was taken away from her and that is part of the reason why she broke into tears eventually.

Overall, it is a very touching film. But as the director of it said it was from her experience, that is why we got more perspective from the girl. It would be good to watch it more from the boy's perspective as well.",True

In-yun! In indian mythology/ Hinduism we also believe strongly in karmic connection between certain souls which cross paths/ leads them to each other for generations. For us also a romantic relationship/ mostly a marriage culminates in finding each other across lifetimes - so I did relate strongly to the romantic ideology the movie is based up on.
The cinematography is amazing and so is the portrayal.. ""You are dreaming in a language I don't understand"".... ""What if this is a past life as well and in our next lives we are something different again""..... The idea of love across time and dimensions is what we do romanticise and believe in but sadly sometimes reality is much harsh. The last scene of the movie was terribly fantastic!",True

Many kids from immigrant families, are not exactly on touch with their roots. Nora, left her name in order to fit in, she speaks Korean mainly with her relatives. In his eyes  she sees her childhood back in Korea,  perhaps a lost piece of her indentity? In the ending scene, she bursts out crying, because she close the door to her past.  She used to be a crybaby 24 years ago. She cried so.many times when she immigrated, but no one seem to listen or care. The ending scene, is the first time she lets her self be vulnerable after all these years. And it s honestly heartbreaking.

@baoai48,2023-09-12T16:02:54Z,0,"I cried just from watching the trailer, but after actually finishing this movie, I felt like it was a movie for ""myself"", and I also felt like I was given something I wasn't ready for yet.

From Korea to America, A24 has made various stories of immigrants, including 「Minari」and 「Everything Everywhere All At Once」. In my case, a childhood friend (she/her) who  is mix of China and England.  I said goodbye to her and immigrated to Japan.

Because I moved at a young age, the two languages and cultures mixed together, and I fell into self-loathing as my own identity, and even now, I struggle with confidence and self-esteem towards language, and understanding that she and I are walking different paths in life, and can never go back. We both switched languages when speaking (she used to speak Chinese, but since moving to America, she mainly speaks English). She felt the closest, but also the furthest away.

I often thought about how I could better express my feelings in words, and tried to beautify memories with her that I couldn't go back to. And also that time I didn't know she was bullying at school.
What if we went to the same school, or if I visited my home country frequently, etc. I think this was because I was afraid of losing something, afraid to face it directly, and at the same time, didn't want to erase what I had.

That feeling at the airport when you arrive, the moment you learn a new language, and when you can't remember how to hug  someone close to you is. This movie beautifully portrays such personal memories. I was happy to see that there were many people who had similar experiences as immigrants like me.

No matter how far away or different things may be, memories with her are very important, and I still have a lot of love for her. When I call her name in Chinese, it sounds so beautiful, and I am happy to think that there are many moments when she is called that name by others in different places. I can't call her that name anymore. And It makes me sad,but It will be okay.

thank you for such a wonderful movie.",True

Why would you even entertain the risk of failing for your childhood crush if your married, pretty sure she would'nt allow her husband to do it.

But if it’s closure in the way this movie portrays it… the long stares, the deep conversations… this feels too intimate for someone who is married. Maybe I have different views on marriage, but to me this seems like borderline emotional infidelity. I’m open to others’ ideas, but I’m struggling to see the beauty in letting your heart so deeply reconnect with someone, when you’ve pledged your heart to someone else.",True

@ulyssestinoco3719,2023-07-12T07:15:32Z,1,"One could look back in their life and have a childhood sweetheart, whilst being actively in love with someone else during the present. Can that current love be forerever? Should they drop that love to find their past love? When they move away from present to bring the past forward, would their past really want them? Chances are the past has a love for themselves. Certainty is a tough feeling to reach when love is involved. Past, present, or future; certainty is possible in all. Are you willing to be certain that your path with respect to the one you love is the right one. The effort you put towards your understanding of the self can make a positive difference. And with understanding, certainly you know what is worth keeping in all facets of your life. To know which love is worth keeping is to bring balance upon yourself. Many doors, many lives, many paths. This notion of multiplicity within ourselves can bring a great mess, and here we should take charge to unravel and sort.",True

Thinking about immigration, the sacrafice it takes from all family members is something I have never felt.  Nor did I ever considered an immigrant's childhood friends/sweethearts left behind.   Reminds me of a little girl named Chow, whose family immigrated to America.  We were shortly classmates. We were six or seven.  Just kids. Sadly, there was a fire in the household on a cold winter night.  She was in the burning house trying to save someone.  We lost her, such a brave soul i only knew for a semester.  I honestly hope I get to meet her in another life.  Agh. My eyes are a bit misty.  I at 52, i know i will never forget her or her family.   As a species, we may move around this globe, but perhaps pieces of our hearts stay in certain locations with the people we fondly remember.

It wasn’t anything serious but I do have fond memories of it. We reconnected in our early 20s and he broke my heart over and over again.

One thing is true though, that it is deeply human to find, at some point in our lives, pragmatism and the ideals of our youth, warring within us. The two are in desperate conflict with each other. Each having their own set of goals, determined to declare victory over the other. Past Lives explores this duality through a very tender and wonderfully aesthetic screenplay. The film's score was amazingly unique as well. Every piece seemed to fit perfectly with the sentiment of the scene. I particularly enjoyed the constant nonverbal communication displayed between the two main characters. There were these frequent and silent moments shared between them that seemed to force the audience into those moments with them. To feel every passing second of them. Great film!",True

Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Some time the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming

All my past lives
They've got nothing on me
Golden eagle, you're the one and only flying high
Through the cities in the sky

I'll take you way back
Countless centuries
Don't you remember?
That you were meant to be my Queen of Hearts
Meant to be my love

Through all of my lives
I never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned

So save that heart for me
Cause girl you know that you're my destiny
Swear to the moon, the stars
The sons, and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water

Hey, I need you now
I've waited oh so long yeah
Baby love, I need you now
I've waited oh so long

Passing seasons
Empty bottles of wine
My ancient kingdom came crashing down without you
Baby child, I'm lost without your love

Diamond sparrow, my moonlight majesty
You know I need you, come flying back to me

Through all of my lives
I never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned

So save that heart for me
Cause girl you know that you're my destiny
Swear to the moon, the stars
The sons, and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Save that heart for me
And girl I'll give you everything you need
Here's to our past lives
Our mothers and fathers
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water

Hey I need you now
I've waited oh so long yeah
Baby love, I need you now
I've waited oh so long
Hey I need you now
I've waited oh so long yeah
Baby love, I need you now
I've waited oh so long

So save that heart for me
Cause girl you know that you're my destiny
Swear to the moon, the stars
The sons, and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water

But i do wish the director had spared more of space and time for indeving on how Hae Sung has been building up a living in Seoul, showing his everyday life let say walking on a busy street downtown in Seoul at night, feeling something missing, the longing for his past love or thinking of her during his military service and how he coped with living his seemingly ordinary life amid the sense of inescapable emptiness on the corner of his mind, trying to dispel the perennial what if question on Nora.   The more scenes of Seoul downtown  streets around his office salaryman life could be a great contrast to Nora's American NewYork life, developing two different paths of one and the same In Yeon.",True

We DM'd a little and he sent me a picture of a postcard I had sent him, when I took a trip to France over winter break. I don't remember sending the postcard. It was 1975-6. The trip to France was insane. I was supposed to meet my sister in Paris. She never showed up.

@chi6003,2023-06-26T05:12:21Z,12,"This film completely tore me apart…

Let me tell you the story about how I recently lost the love of my life.

We met two years ago and instantly fell in love. He is simply wonderful. Everything with him was both easy and intense. However, last year, I left him because I wanted to pursue my arts career in another country. Even though he wanted to make it work despite the distance, I couldn’t afford any distractions at the time. So I left and we cut off all contact. But I was still secretly hoping with all my heart that we would have a chance in the future. I’m a believer of fate and I’ve always believed that whatever is meant for you will always find its way back. 

Fast forward to this year. He moved to a different country. And because fate has always been on my side, work has assigned me in that same country and I will be moving in August to the city where he is now based.

But fate isn’t really on my side this time around… Just last week, I looked up his socials with hopes of reaching out to him and letting him know that I’ll be moving to his city. I wanted us to pick up where we left off…

But then I discovered that he is already engaged. To a lovely woman who has a striking resemblance to me.

As much as I want him back, I don’t want to disorient him nor do I want to be the cause of another woman’s pain.

All I could do was cry silently as I looked through his Instagram account.

And seeing this film brought back the regret and heartache I felt when I found out I can no longer be in his life in that capacity.",True

@liyan8800,2023-06-16T20:36:20Z,1,"The term 'in-yun' originates from China and is called '姻缘'. 

The term ""姻缘"" in Chinese culture refers to the concept of marriage and the union between two people that is believed to be predetermined by fate or destiny. It encompasses the idea that a person's marriage partner is chosen or arranged by some higher power, rather than being solely based on personal choice or preference.

In English, ""姻缘"" can be translated as ""fateful connection"" or ""predestined relationship."" It suggests the belief that a marriage is not simply a result of two individuals coming together by chance, but rather a result of a deeper cosmic connection that brings them together.

The concept of ""姻缘"" often carries a sense of romantic destiny and the idea that the union between two people is meant to be. It is often associated with the notion of soulmates or the belief that there is a perfect match for each person in the world.",True

@shafeydanish,2023-05-30T06:27:15Z,1,"Looks like either a) an elaborate romanticization of infidelity or b) what an achingly difficult thing it is to remain faithful to your partner, and what a BIIIIIIG sacrifice it entails. That is when the partner is 'good'. Loving, honest, liberal. 

Oh, and we probably get to see what a painful thing it is to do the ""right thing"", in allowing your wife to meet with her childhood male friend and spend time bonding with him, despite all the caveman jealousy getting in the way.

if this is indeed what the movie is, I am surprised at how out of touch the writer/director of this movie is. This is not how modern romances work at all. This all smacks of the early modern era, of novels like Lady Chatterly's Lover or Anna Karenina. I thought with the advent of the 21st century, the casual way in which relationships are both formed and broken and the toll it is taking on individuals and families, the emphasis would shift to those qualities that are required to keep couples together, not those that will tear them apart in the name of some whimsical notion of 'soul mates'.",True

@jthwang,2023-03-15T10:42:56Z,0,"In-Yeon talked about in the beginning is a bit more specific than providence or fate. In means cause and Yeon is fate, and it describes the way things tend to form relationships with each other. I believe it derives from the concept of karma from way back.

There is however, a wrong explanation that some people think is true, because well, it makes more sense. A much more common definition of In means human. So if you talk about In-Yeon that you have with a person, you're talking about the fated relationship you have with that person. In-Yeon is actually used to describe relationships between people more than it does things.",True

Circumstances took her across the world. I always knew she was the one and on starry nights, red sunsets, during milestones and in silent moments of reflection, I would wonder if I was still in her heart as she was in mine. 

When we finally met up, I remember gazing into her eyes for hours searching for answers, we said so much to each other without saying a single word. Turns out, I have been in her heart as much as she’s been in mine. 

3 months later this past January I travelled to meet her family. We’re hoping to get engaged mid year and planning a wedding for early 2024. Timing is everything and in our hearts and in our core, we always hoped to be each others forevers.",True

Now, watching the trailer, I wondered: what if I stayed, would we date, would we break up? I don’t know, I will forever never know, and it breaks my heart everytime I think of him because no matter how hard I try to deny my feelings, our connection is real.

@taoben5962,2023-02-27T11:15:16Z,0,"I don’t thank t’ils a great idea…. I wouldn't watch this movie. To highlight a childhood love, or even to glorify childhood love... it just makes us more selfish. My reasoning is much deeper than we can hear. We are obsessed with pure love to the point of looking for what we will never find. Because the real purity is in the acceptance of itself. We must all simply stop looking for love but let it come to us. Any form of benevolence by the way. I wouldn't watch this movie.",True

Thinking a possibility of togetherness in the future just makes it more romantic and far reaching. 
It's something we have all experienced or will do so later in the future.
This movie takes a toll on our deepest thoughts and emotions and gives us a chance to judge the character's acts and actions.
In simple words, it's another possibility ventured which might bring out disastrous outcomes or sweet memories for the two. 
P S: it's not a chance encounter rather a pre planned meeting with a friend after a long time.",True

The husbands empathy is not weakness, but such a powerful strength that almost no one processes. He is staring straight into the abyss FILLED with emotion, but he is resolute that he MUST NOT let his emotions ruin the happiness of someone he loves, even if it takes them away from him. To tell your body and heart ""NO!"" when every fiber of your being tells you otherwise is a strength I have only possessed maybe once in my life, and experiencing it once absolutely changed me. I have purpose and a direction in life now that I never had before, simply by coming  to understand the importance of empathy. This movie looks like it can provide me with some great perspective, and perspective is what I search for.",True

The trailer didn't give me any chills whatsoever, it just looked like a cheating story. Many people been there, done that. On both sides. 
I don't think I would enjoy seeing the romance when it's built on a betrayal of a loving partner. If a husband was a jerk, it would be a totally different story. But seeing how he doesn't deserve this pain and she emotionally cheats - don't know if it overflowed into physical cheating - she hurts someone whom she promised to love and cherish forever for the cheap and short-lived ""butterflies"" effect...

@bluewin13,2023-02-23T07:07:39Z,11810,"""Even simply brushing clothes with someone is fate"" (옷깃만 스쳐도 인연) is an old Korean proverb that means every interaction between you and another person—even a stranger on the street—is never an accident, but rather the elaborate result of your past lives and theirs intertwining to make that momentary interaction happen. And if even the most seemingly trivial of interactions are the result of elaborate workings of fate (인연), then something as significant as meeting the love of your life is the result of 8000 겁 of fate. This is a commonly known Buddhist teaching. 겁 (Gup) is a measurement of time. Imagine a massive boulder, and imagine that a single raindrop falls on that boulder once every 1000 years. The amount of time it would take for the boulder to finally crack from the water droplets is 1 겁. A single 겁 is an unfathomably long period of time, so 8000 겁 is something that's hard to even attempt to imagine. The saying goes that for every married couple, there's at least 8000 겁 of 인연 (fate) from their past lives that led them to each other.",True

@repentancefaith3618,2023-02-23T04:55:11Z,0,"Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                        ,/., .//., /. ,./ ,/.,./",True

I have nothing against racial diversity and stories about different people from different cultures, as long as the stories are good and not agenda based. But A24 used to release movies about aliens that looked like ScarJo and killer female robots, Ex Machina anyone. Sci-fi and supernatural stuff. Films and plotlines the big studios just won't make anymore because of greed and wanting to make a fast buck. Stemming from a mostly creatively bankrupt, activist infested industry. But this, so far looks like a generic snore! Bring back the old A24 please! We'll  I guess NEON is the new A24 until their ruined too!

@jesuschristisreturningsoon640,2023-02-23T00:05:17Z,1,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""   
 -John 3:16
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself on the cross and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends

When Jesus Christ returns, he will take his children home, and hundreds of millions of people will disappear in a brief moment! When you see this event take place, please remember these words, and understand that the Rapture has just taken place! Please remember that the Christians tried to warn you of this coming day, and that God is real, and his name is Jesus Christ!

Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.

""And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."" Revelation 22:12

May God Bless you all in Jesus name!

The END of life as we know it is upon us my Friends!

@violetbluegreen9307,2023-02-22T15:44:00Z,4282,"Hey, I'm from South Korea and I can relate to this trailer... Almost same thing happened to me recently. Around 17 years ago, when I was in elementary, I met a boy whose name was ""Present"" in Korean. He was my first crush. I liked his shiny round eyes, a cute wide smile, and white teeth. Sadly, I had to move to another  school a year later. 18 years passed, and we met each other this January. We have become both 25. He studies in medical school and I just came back to S.Korea after obtaining a diploma from another country. I didn't know he had been reading all my posts on my public diary for a few months when I was back in France. Though he knew the one who was writing the diary was me, he never said ""Hi"" to me. Then one day I deleted a link that had access to my public diary, so he missed a chance to let me know. 
A few years passed, and he noticed one comment in the comment section of one youtube video which showed a whole view of our hometown where we used to play together. That comment was, surprisingly, written by me. He noticed that it was me because I wrote down some of my personal background in the comment. He already knew I was living in France and I had a very special surname that stood out. 
So we met each other once again through Youtube and we talked hours and hours on social media. We finally met each other this January and we had a nice Italian lunch, drank coffee and talked for hours and hours... I think we had a nice time. 
We are not together tho. Maybe it was because of a bad timing or maybe because I've been having some issues with my mentality and physical health or maybe because he was in senior year at medical school...or maybe because I seemed such a deep person to him. BUT the important thing is, I have a feeling that we are still connected and one day we will see each other once again at right time and a right place.
Magic happens to those who believe in magic :)
