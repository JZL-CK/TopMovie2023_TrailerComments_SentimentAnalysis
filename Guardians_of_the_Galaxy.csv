@user-dr2yz8um3d,2024-05-05T23:05:40Z,1,"1 year old already!!!

I saw this with my older sister and her boyfriend 
Crazy this is director James Gunn's last outing since he's going to be in charge of the next wave of movies for DC

The villain here the High Evolutionary is made of narcissism, zealotry, and single-mindedness obsessed with perfection 
Even though the movie is 2 hours and 29 min it gets by with all these actors as these characters 
9 years they become people who’s pasts are not squeaky clean, they learn to get past the trauma theyve experienced 

Again I admit several parts I wasn't expecting to cry
Especially around Rocket's dark origins, they insert a big commentary on perfecting a species and animal experimentation
Not to mention an anti-fascist message
I still wanted Adam Warlock to be more of a central villain because Will Poulter is a good actor be he feels lost in the shuffle
But the movie does a great job wrapping up this trilogy and making this rag tag team of heroes leave quite the mark
All of them have their respective stories tied up in a nice bow
Glad the action is cool, the effects, the laughs, and the tender moments work without being interrupted by a corny joke
The production design is quite colorful and the makeup effects with the costumes
There’s the hands that created us and then there’s the hands that guide us, we don’t have to spend our days hating ourselves, stupid people still make us laugh, nobody asks to be perfected or improved, when God isn’t around someone else steps in",True

@BensCoffeeRants,2023-12-18T04:00:25Z,3,"Overall Great movie, Loved it.  I immediately recognized the Laika (Russian Astronaut dog) reference and was saddened by this, although this puts an optimistic spin on that story dog somehow survived to gain telekinetic powers (help from some friendly aliens?) perhaps this twist was inspired by the brilliant fan made music video for Sharon Van Ettens 'I Can't Breathe"" song which on its own is already depressing enough, search for the video, ""I Can't Breathe, Sharon Van Etten, Laika"" 

Spoiler Alert: 

One thing that bothered me also related to the dog was the whole bad dog thing, it was an obvious and lame set up which I saw coming a mile away, plus the whole reason the guy was saying bad dog was purely because he was jealous the dog did something better than him and was insecure, which is pretty pathetic of his character especially after the dog repeatedly lets him know how much that bothers him, only after the dog saves his life is the dog redeemed to be a 'good boy' again... That's a D*ck Move! 

And the bad guy is supposed to so smart, yet doesn't realize sometimes getting an outside perspective can be beneficial in solving problems, and that different people, or creatures have different types or areas of intelligence.  If everyone was equally smart and did things in the exact same way, it would be pretty boring I think. 
Also with all that bio tech, he couldn't have fixed himself a better face? :D  Literally cut and paste is the best he's got !? :D",True

Nothing left from the anarchy comedy of the first 2 movies.
Terrible, ABSOLUTELY terrible overacting by Chukwudi Iwuji, WAY too much drama, after around 90 minutes  I realized that I still had 130 minutes to go and I was already bored like hell.

There a some funny scenes in it (Thanks to Nebula, Mantis and Drax) but that´s about it.

Also the chosen music was terrible cause they tried too hard!!

If her future self fell for Quill then she must still have those qualities but not her memories and experience that she’s been through, so we could say that there’s potential (hints of them frequently staring). Gamora fulfilled her future with Quill and it was the end of their story after the cliff. I think it’s up to past Gamora now if she wants to fulfill the path of future Gamora and if she decides to be with Quill or change it. She did found a home with the ravagers but we did see glimpse of her rekindling her experience with the guardians just not to the fullest.

Now with Pom Klementieff clearly moving into bigger roles with Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning. I hope her charcter also moves in more interesting directions within the MCU. 

Given her direct connections with the Kree & the Priests of Parma. As well as within Secret Wars. Of which she has a direct role as part of the Dragons of Shang Chi. 

There are several alternative realities i could see this go. Overall Guardians 3 was over far to soon & in some ways missed opertunites. As we could have gotten more from The Collector. Which is more central to the entire MCU then some might think. I hope he retuns in the future. :)",True

Высший эволюционер одарил Адама камнем души, одним из могущественных камней бесконечности, с которыми Адам навсегда связал свою судьбу. Для спасения вселенной Уорлок часто вступал в союз с земными героями, а также основывал такие команды, как Дозор бесконечности и Стражи галактики.""

Обладает сверхчеловеческой физической силой, ловкостью и исцеляющим фактором.""

Тут интересней, Таноса в комиксах называют самаритянином и некой необходимой силой смерти. 

""Содо́м (ивр. ‏סְדוֹם‏‎, Sədom — букв. «горящий»; греч. Σόδομα) и Гомо́рра (ивр. ‏עֲמוֹרָה‏‎, ʿAmora — букв. «погружение, потопление»; греч. Γόμορρα) — два известных библейских города, которые, согласно Библии, были уничтожены Богом за грехи их жителей, в частности, за распутство. В более поздней библейской традиции Содом и Гоморра — олицетворение высшей степени греховности, которая навлекает на себя гнев Всевышнего Бога""

И это тоже отсылки к первоисточнику. Думаю понятно к какому. В какой то степени Танос наказание за грехи, а не просто какой-то там плохой дядя из ваших сериальчиков.

Это театралка Лилит, связь не только с лунным,  но и в принципе демоническим драконом. Её связь с девушкой раскрывает весь смысл существовния материи, как тьмы и света. Но к её подруге мы ещё вернемся - самый сложный персонаж в комиксах Стражи Галактики.

Мне уже надоело, в том то и дело, что я могу так весь день... Ещё парочку, а потом быть может... Итак, с этим типом всё просто. Он зелёное инопланетное создание, которое в добавок убило Таноса, если вы понимаете о чём я) Если читать то нарратив и концепт понятен.

Персонаж сыграл ключевую роль в событиях Annihilation (2006), Annihilation: Conquest (2007), War of Kings (2008) и The Thanos Imperative (2009). Впоследствии Звёздный Лорд возглавил космическую команду супергероев Стражи Галактики, появившуюся в перезапуске одноимённого комикса в 2008 году. Персонаж появился в различного рода мерчендайзе Marvel, включая мультсериалы, игрушки и коллекционные карты""

Этот персонаж самый долбанутый. Его тупо не правильно собрали, разобрали и подогнали к попсе. Как по мне, самая не интересная личность в marvel. Его в разных проектах делают по разному. 

""Фила-Велл - вымышленный персонаж , комикс супергерой , появляющийся в Американские комиксы , изданные Marvel Comics . Она была известна под именами Квазар , Капитан Марвел и Мученик . Она была создана Питером Дэвидом и в Captain Marvel (vol. 5) # 16 (январь 2004).

Ее имя происходит от научной классификации филума , одного из уровней организации (таксонов ) для классификации жизни . Это ссылка на тот факт, что имя ее брата Генис-Велл происходит от рода , одной из других классификаций форм жизни.""

Это наша старшая кровь высшая цивилизация у которой любовь с драконом. Помните наверно, да? Выше было. Стала зваться ""мученик"" при интереснейших обстоятельствах отсылка к Обите Учиха.

Короче, надоели, если вы называете себя технарем и математиком и не знаете азов псиполей то идёте нахер. Фильм снят вовсе не правильно, он даже не передает настоящие характеры. И бойтесь эльфов сучки 👽",True

I'm so surprised I was wrong!
guys, literally... This movie ROCKS!
Not for kids anyway. It has very mature thematics and explicit violence, so not exactly pg13. More like pg16.
It's very good. The story is interesting and with a good writing, the villain is a very well done psycho (the actor is astonishing), main characters are all memorable and funny and it's full of good messages.
It gives very positive and optimistic vibes! At the end of the movie you really care for everyone and you want to see what will happen to them all.
What can I say? I thought James Gunn was a lazy incompetent, but it turned out he's very good. I'm genuinely very glad to say that this movie was a very good work.

@Jo-be9ol,2023-05-25T14:43:37Z,1,"Hi Marvel, yesterday I watched your show. I saw the insinuation of a Racoon swing his hands with his sharp nails, back and forth across the face of a man, slicing the skin and nose off, in revenge. It just seemed a little to….hmmm… like your “creative makers” have been playing way to many - what is that game, got it from google “Quake” games and are now completely desensitised with graphic violence or it’s insinuation. When I was around 16, good old Hannibal came out, where a man cut his own face off. I couldn’t stomach it. Age restriction? About 16… age on yours? PG13. What? Liked I’d cover my sons eyes and ears at that age? (Eye roll). So I’m curious what your target market is because I am so flipping confused. I have adored this franchise as a “young” adult, but now it’s shifted to “rescuing children” and then “initiating” them into the packs. It’s a clear signal (if end game wasn’t enough) that my era is over. Ok no problem… until I guess I decide to watch it on the big screen and passively sit by and witness the gruesome disfigurement of a man (who seems to have no arms) by a…. Racoon (sorry rocket, we’re from the real world). It was horrific. This is no longer child’s play. And I am Now one of those annoying cis gender Caucasian (protective) mothers that doesn’t like how this is presented and voicing her dissent. It’s like watching someone get raped and saying absolutely nothing. Just watching. Let’s be honest you creative geniuses, it F***s with the mind.“Please, she said it herself, she’s cis gender AND Caucasian” -> silenced. I’m just so tired of this loss of dignity, why not stop the Racoon, pique his conscious? Out of original script? How well did that script do after that point with dollar sales originally? Are we on the downward spiral? Reaping what little can be reaped? Or progressing towards externalisation where desensitisation is a must and sensation is provided in grandeur dollops! 
Basically: I would like it if the adults (creators) that have personally over exposed themselves, would tame their creative takes for the young who are yet to embark on “real life”. Mic drop and Marvel loyalty sadly gone :( 
Pick up mic again: Could say more on the other underlying dull takes but me sitting passively while a Racoon exacts emotional revenge… well… let me book a therapy session (the over exposed lads congratulate themselves with a job effectively well done. 
Me clap: yay,      well       done.        brilliant      art     work for   Target   Group    13+      year     olds. You   only     live     once.)

The second MCU movie i've watched (the first being  MoM) This movie was emotional but my friends at school pretty much ruin every emotional scenes. A lot of the scenes were funny too 😂.

@limphocyticpredominance38,2023-05-15T14:14:48Z,663,"[mild spoiler alert]

What I loved most about this movie is that it wasn't dealing with some multiversal threat that required me to watch previous TV series, with cliffhangers that left me waiting for the Next Big Movie for the payoff.

Instead, it told a self-contained story with lots of heart about characters I previously knew nothing about, but learned to slowly love and appreciate -- including a tree that only says three words, and an abrasive rodent. But somehow I left that theater in tears, full of love and laughter for the last 2.5 hours that zoomed by.

@Kilroy_5150,2023-05-12T23:02:23Z,1,"As a ""What If"" movie, this movie did great, because almost none of it is true comic cannon. I could have done without Mantis landing with a ""snap her neck"" landing every few scenes. The race-swapping of The High Evolutionary made Herbert Windam (his real name) with an african american actor that ""over-played"" his part.Marvel did that with Kang and made him look like an idiot. They made The High Evolutionary look so out of control and uncool in this movie.

Everything else was great.

To be honest, now, the comics are molding to the movies and they're just killing the good cannon by doing this. All of these movies should be classified as ""What If"" movies because none of them hold true to the comics they're made from.

@ch1701a,2023-05-11T07:04:04Z,0,"I can't wait to see this new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.  
It's the last Marvel movie director Tommy Gunn is making before he goes to Warner Bros to make the new Harry Potter DCU movies, so you know he is going to put in a lot of Easter eggs and tie the 2 franchises together.  
It's going to be interesting to see if Chris Evan's character, Peter Quilt, and Zoe Kravitz's character, Kimora, get back together.  I like that 'Will They' or 'Won't They' playful banter.  
I aslo heard that Hulk Hogan who plays Traxx, requested that his character be killed off so he could follow director Tommy Gunn to Warner Bros to do the Harry Potter DCU movies.  
They must have got an AI to do the character of Root's voice, which was done by Paul Walker in the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies because Root is all grown up in this movie and Paul Walker is dead.  
I heard in this movie, Bradley Cooper's character, Space Racoon, gets a love interest.  CGI is amazing at how they can fit Bradley Cooper into the Space Racoon suit.  
I also heard that this movie is making the LBGTQ community happy with the relationship that develops between Mathis and Kimora's sister, Neptuna.  I really didn't expect that but Disney had to do something to make the public happy after that whole She-Hulk debacle.
Anyway, can't wait to see this when it comes out on the pirated streaming sites.  Phase 18 of the Marvel Universe has sucked so far so hopefully they can redeem themselves with this movie.",True

@davidn4125,2023-05-07T16:08:30Z,3,"One of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen.  I am sick of movies that supplement weak plot lines with music and cute animals to get an emotional response from the audience.  Could not wait until it was over.  If you liked Jurassic Park 3 you will like this movie. The movie starts off with this Warlock character infiltrating the Guardian compound to capture Rocket because the High Evolutionary needs to study him.  So what's the first thing Warlock does when he meets Rocket?  He basically kills him with a blast to the chest if it weren't for the efforts of the rest of the Guardians to keep him alive.  What?  Doesn't the high evolutionary need him alive to study him?  Oh never mind just don't think about it too much.  From there the movie continues it's downward spiral with ridiculous plot twists that come out of nowhere with little explanation.  And there is this ridiculous plot line where the Guardians land on this earth like planet run by genetically engineered animals who just so happen to drive around in 1980's Ford's and Chevy's. WHAT?!?!?  Oh, never mind just don't think about it.  And while on this planet Drax clotheslines some poor innocent guy riding by on a Motorcycle to steal his bike.  It looks like he killed the guy since he's lying in the street not moving.   I felt sorry for the guy lying in the street and hated Drax's character at that point.  Good job Disney with character development.  By the way ... the scene where Drax calls the imprisoned children idiots and morons was so cringe worthy I almost had to leave the theater.",True

I had to give my dog a hug after seeing this movie because the film deals with topics like animal cruelty so heavily. I'm probably gonna avoid movie trailers (especially for MCU films) from now on though. I watched a bunch of the promotional stuff Marvel released for this movie and the trailers made me tear up before I went to see Volume 3. Because of this I went in expecting the film to be an emotional rollercoaster and it was much harder to tear up during the actual movie. Great movie, much better if you go into it %100 blind!",True

I'm not gonna give any spoilers so you wanna know what I mean you? Gotta? Go watch it yourself but I enjoyed very much as much as I enjoy all of.  Yeah lots of action like the movies always do and new characters were introduced. I was just great all around lots of spoilers of Easter. Eggs got to look for those there was lots and lots of Easter eggs there. I'm not gonna say anything you gotta find your own stuff.  But I enjoyed every bit of it. I was in the theater with 65 people and there was probably half of that were. There to where they are to see the movie when I want to get my tickets. It looked like there was sold out but there was only it. Was still a lot? Of room for people but yeah it's especially worth checking out. I would check it out again I enjoyed it that much.  I give it a 13 hour 13 skulls I say go to. I said to go check it out I'm not gonna give it a spoilers. I'm not that type of person to get spoilers but I say 13 and I have 13 skulls. You'll check it out let me know what you it was worth it. It was definitely worth going to say check out tomorrow's view. That should be foreman if I am correct,True

@NickOtis0707,2023-05-01T23:27:06Z,0,"Even though this movie looks very good. I would never idolize any movie above my Lord & Savior Jesus Christ. Because the Lord holds everything together and This is what the LORD says: “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Could you build me a temple as good as that? Could you build me such a resting place?  Colossians 1:15-17 He is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of all creation for by him all things were created In heaven and on Earth visible and invisible whatever thrones or dominion's or rulers or authorities all things were created through him and for him and he is before all things and in him all things hold together. Amen the reason I say this because I'm a Christian I'll never be ashamed of the Lord Jesus Christ and his name of the good news of the Gospel.. always remember give thanks to the Lord for he is good and always have an honest conversation and prayer before the Lord Christ Jesus. Don't be ashamed to take your fears your worries your mistakes to him and lay everything at Jesus Christ feet. Jesus Christ is waiting at the other side of the door and he's knocking waiting for you to open it for him to come into your life. It also says in the Lord's word 2nd Corinthians 4:4 and their case the God of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God. Always remember to love your neighbors as yourself no matter what even if you come in contact with a negative person that's Christians to always let our light shine before others that's why they'll give glory to our Father who is in heaven through Christ Jesus to the holy Spirit the Lord's spirit.

Disregarding the love for characters - he likes to shock everyone, taking their lives to create emotions. Guardians 1 & 2 will always be one of my favorite MCU movies. But the last one.. will most likely destroy it all. Would fit into disneys playbook since Endgame. Also the odds are that most likely all male characters will die, while the females save the universe. 🙄",True

@peterberg8417,2023-04-04T13:42:50Z,0,"Theaters need to offer more variety again especially for adults who are sick of these childish super hero movies dominating every multiplex. It saddens me that films like the Fabelmans (directed by one of the greatest directors of our time) flops at the box office while these brainless superhero movies lap up the audience's money. Unfortunately that shows the dumbing down of the audience and how the attention spans of functioning adults can't appreciate a drama with great dialogue and cinematography over a kid's movie like this. Adults are regressing and culture is suffering because of it. Luckily, there are tons of movies from like pre-2017 that I can go back to watch that give me a mature story for anyone over the age of 16, but it saddens me that we will be getting less movies like that in theaters because average people cannot be bothered to think or challenge their brains for 2 hours anymore. This all started when Disney bought Fox and crushed Fox Searchlight Studios, relegating those films to streaming where nobody will see them and they won't enter the cultural zeitgeist. Fox was the last of the major studios offering adult films. Yes, we have A24 but that is a minor studio and is basically a footnote in the film world these days. Even if Everything Everywhere All at Once (one of their films) won best picture at the Oscars, the Oscars are losing their influence over movie-goers due to many reasons that I won't go into so a best picture win does not hold as much value as it used to. And it doesn't help that Everything Everywhere All at Once is basically a superhero movie anyway. RIP American intelligence and thought. I fear for the future when the TikTok generation takes over and becomes tasked with curating and preserving the art and literature of our past because I fear they will just cancel it all outright for challenging their perception of the world in which they live.",True

Some guardians aren’t gonna make it to the end of this movie. Gunn is such a talented writer. We can connect to these characters so much more than others. i’d go as far as to say the guardians are the most well written characters in the mcu. We followed them, saw them come together from broken pasts. They are a family and they love and care for each other like we do our families. We’ve seen them love, grieve, laugh, and cry, just like we do with our families. It’s gonna be a rough emotional ride.

Kinda makes the racewash casting make sense, because if he hates imperfections, I can believe he did surgery on himself to the point that he changed his skin color, but cant fix his own face, so he gotta wear human skin over it.

Is Chukwudi Iwuji going to show us the High-Evolutionary in full body Armor including his helmet from the comics and what do you think Will Poulter is going to be like as Adam Warlock without the Soul Stone?

What is going to be the plot of the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 movie apart from the High-Evolutionary and Adam Warlock eliminating some of it's members like Rocket Raccoon? 

Is this movie going to be about saving Counter-Earth from the High-Evolutionary while trying to get Adam Warlock on their side?

Apart from Rocket Raccoon who's too obvious, Which all members of the Guardians of the Galaxy do you think are not going to survive in this movie?

How come this alternate Version of Gamora didn't get snapped with past Thanos and his army from Avengers Endgame since Gamora was the first member of the Guardians of the Galaxy to be killed in the MCU? What type of role do you think she's going to play in this movie?

Again, REALLY hope they don't have Peter and this Gamora get together. Starting a relationship with an alternate reality version of someone you were lovers with but they died just feels wrong. Would fit better if this movie goes for a ""moving on"" theme.

Was considering the possibility Peter could die in this one. But after how much focus the trailer put on that shot of them carrying his body, I now strongly doubt that'll happen. We'll probably get either a fake out death or a Disney Death at worst.",True

@johnpearson1258,2023-02-13T15:02:58Z,0,"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",True

These movies do stand on their own while feeling every bit as important and impactful as any other MCU film. They are just so insanely awesome in a way that you feel you KNOW these characters. You understand them and feel their emotions and humor (or lack thererof) from the moment you are first introduced to them. These characters are so seriously flawed in a way we all are. From the first film, you can pretty much relate to what each and every character is feeling. The writing, casting, acting is insane.  Even something as simple as Glenn Close' ""prick"" comment in the first film. You immediately can relate to her situation and feeling even though her situation is so absurdly beyond our experience.  I adore these characters and am very thankful they exist. To everyone involved in bringing them to the big screen all the way to when each debuted in comic book lore... thank you.",True

Jesus will soon be seen by all men, women, and children in the clouds. Jesus is returning now! Believe and be saved.

Exodus 3:14 (God speaking)
And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

John 8:58 (Jesus speaking)
Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

John 10:30 (Jesus speaking)
I and my Father are one.

Isaiah 9:6
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, *The everlasting Father,* The Prince of Peace.

Matthew 1:23
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, *God with us.*

John 1:1 & 14
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
14 And the Word was made flesh (Lord Jesus), and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

John 8:24 (Jesus speaking)
I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

John 14:9 (Jesus speaking)
Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?

Hebrews 1:1-3, & 8 (God calls His Son ""O God"" because Jesus IS God in the flesh)
1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

1 John 5:7
For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

Titus 2:13!!!
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

Revelation 1:7
Behold, he cometh with clouds; *and every eye shall see him,* and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

Isaiah 44:6 (God speaking)
Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

Revelation 1:8 (Jesus speaking)
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, *the Almighty.*

There Are None Righteous / How To Be Saved

Romans 3:10 & 23
10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:!!!
23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

Luke 5:31-32 (Jesus speaking)
31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.
32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

1 Peter 3:18 (The word “quicken” means “to make alive”)
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

Romans 10:9
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Acts 4:12
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

Ephesians 2:8-9
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Repent of your sins or suffer the consequences. Lord Jesus died in our places personally to take the death punishment that sin deserves and then resurrected by the power of God. Believe this and sincerely repent of your sins each time you sin and you will have eternal life and nothing to fear. Fail to repent and you will end up in the Lake of Fire.",True

@nicholasjames8689,2023-02-13T04:18:37Z,2,"Man, at 1:15, for some reason, just seeing Lylla the Otter laughing on the floor with Rocket made me tear up, but in a joyful way.

Just seeing Lylla finally in the MCU despite the fact that Vol. 3 is the final chapter in the Gotg story is a dream come true.

I know a lot people think & say Rocket is gonna die just based on what the trailers are representing what is gonna go down in the film, but I honestly think it’s a way to throw people off and show that it will in fact be someone else in the guardians. I will not say who I think it will be, but I’m almost confident it’s not Rocket.

Out of all things shown so far, I’m honestly looking forward to seeing Rocket & Lylla’s relationship, they’ve had a romantic history together (as her name was shown for Rocket in the interrogation scene in Vol. 1), and I have a feeling in a positive way that they’ll be one of, if not the best couple ever written in the MCU, and they’re not even human characters. 

I’m prepared but at the same time not prepared for the emotions this movie will bring, not just for Rocket’s backstory and someone potentially getting killed off (again, not Rocket, but someone within the guardians), but also Lylla’s character as well, she will definitely be equally as important as the High Evolutionary as he “created” both her & Rocket.",True

 -John 3:16
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself on the cross and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends

When Jesus Christ returns, he will take his children home, and hundreds of millions of people will disappear in a brief moment! When you see this event take place, please remember these words, and understand that the Rapture has just taken place! Please remember that the Christians tried to warn you of this coming day, and that God is real, and his name is Jesus Christ!

Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.

""And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."" Revelation 22:12

May God Bless you all in Jesus name!

The END of life as we know it is upon us my Friends!

Wake up! REPENT before it is too late!",True
