@user-dr2yz8um3d,2024-04-01T02:39:34Z,0,"1 year old!


23 years since the first attempt to adapt the infamous fantasy board game and Hollywood tries their hand again 
The original dungeons and dragons was a complete misfire that got so many things wrong from the casting to the acting to the effects 
Even worse was an outdated black stereotype character that didn't help 

This is truly a more fun and solid adaptation of the beloved board game with plenty of references and inside knowledge for fans from the strategies to even the cartoon series
It's very lively, colorful, very detailed when it comes to the creatures whether cgi or practical effects, and the actors make the material very light hearted
There really is though so much lore, backstory, and exposition to pay attention to 
The fun stuff doesn't exactly kick in until the last half when the High Sun tournament starts making it actually feel like a game 
Some tighter pacing would‚Äôve helped to get to the more flashier parts 
Yet plenty of laughs and remarkable chemistry of Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Sophia Lillis, and Justice Smith make for a smooth ride 
Think of this like Monty Python meets ‚ÄòPrincess Bride‚Äô 
The filmmakers if they play their cards right so to speak might have a franchise on their hands given how much love they have for the source material",True

He manages to surprise the viewer with the unexpected way he reuses elements that he has previously clearly presented. In general, to thwart complex situations, for lack of ingenuity and imagination, authors decree things, project unknown elements into action...
For example in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" it was decreed that Superman would be more resistant to the effects of kryptonite in order to defeat Doomsday. In Spectre, it was decreed that Ernst Stavro Blofeld would take James Bond's watch for a trivial thing, which is completely inconsistent. We find this logic in all the blockbusters. This film is the one where this mistake is made the least. In it we see characters facing difficult situations and using inventive ways to solve them. That's why I consider it the most successful blockbuster. From a cinematographic point of view, I place it above all Marvel films, DC, the Matrix saga (my favorite cinematic project), Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter,... In short! The most serious, inventive cinematic work I've seen so far and I'm all the happier, because finally the legendary Dungeons & Dragons saga is cinematically honored. Finally, a real nice cinematic surprise!",True

It would‚Äôve gave the film a more spontaneous feel too it whilst also having a legit story. Kinda like How the princess bride feels when you watch it. Only have the players be at a table.

I've played all the games since then so it was nice to mention things like Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter, although it usually wasn't much more than a reference. The writers came out early and said they had fun emasculating the male characters in this movie. That was an early indication that this would be a movie focusing more on social politics rather than entertainment. Unfortunately, that was correct. Almost all the men here are physically weak and idiots whereas all the women are strong and intelligent. One girl with no armor or weapons beats up 20+ soldiers in full plate mail and throws them around like rag dolls. Even the dragon was made to be an obese idiot. One guy was an actual housewife.

@dimetrodon2250,2023-04-15T03:27:26Z,444,"I was blown away by how accurate to DnD this movie was. It feels like a love letter to DnD made by people who play DnD. I was expecting the usual watered down ""made for general audiences"" MCU style film and instead we got what was essentially a DnD campaign in movie form. Everything from the locations, to the spells, to the monsters, to the magic items all perfectly represented DnD. The film also utilizes show-dont-tell in a way that most Hollywood movies struggle with due to their need for as general of an audience as possible. Nobody needs to explain the bag of holding, or what a displacer beast is, or how breaking concentration affects certain spells, unless the explanation itself is relevant to the plot. Even when they do explain things, it never feels clunky or out of place.",True

@justjayjustjay5054,2023-03-07T05:19:28Z,0,Man.... the creators of this movie missed out on a GREAT opportunity. They should have made it to fit in the 80's realm like the Stranger Things franchise since that's a big thing now for kids & adults. They could have made it similar to the old 80's cartoon and have a group of kids playing a  D&D game. One recites some type of spell out of a book and they get drawn into the D&D world almost like Jumanji. They then have to complete missions in order to get closer to coming back to their world. Could have added in parents ranting about it being devil worshipping etc the way it was portrayed in the 80s as well. This storyline could've gone on for awhile.,True

If I played ‚ÄúHungry Hungry Hippos‚Äù with my friends in a deathly serious way, is it right to assume that everyone else did the same and therefore the movie must be that way? Stop saying that making this thing ‚Äúsuperdumb‚Äù was the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù because that‚Äôs how you played D&D with your friends, I don‚Äôt believe you did, specially with those $u$piciou$ly $hort comments and the pronouns in your profiles that are used by people that hate nerd stuff. Just like any other board game, everyone has a different experience every single time you played it, even if you do it with the same group of friends. Movies are meant to be for the general audience that didn‚Äôt played them exactly like you did, and quite probably didn‚Äôt even played it at all. BUT there is one element that is totally objective and every single person that ever played the game experienced exactly the same way as everyone else, The MANUAL, The MANUAL which is not subjective as your defense is. Every detail about the characters and their world is in the manual and is written seriously, there is no goofy ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù in it all. What they are doing here is mocking the seriousness of the source material from their very subjective and narcissistic point of view. If they had followed the manual instead, or the books, or comics that were written afterwards, they could had filled the expectations of the biggest part of the audience.

None of that matters now since I doubt WotC/Hasbro are going to get over themselves before premier. That's a bummer.

But the Dungeons& Dragons universe has tons of books that are great for television that could lead into major motion pictures. Such as Greyhawk , DarkSun, Spell Jammer , DRAGON LANCE(One of my Personal favourites ) Forgotten Realms And RAVEN LOFT (AN OTHER FAVOURITE) . IMAGINE going to the Imax and watching two waring armies in the sky of dragons and their riders battle each other with 6' foot long dragon lances . Dragons of metallic gold and silver vs Dragons of Black and Red grappling each other as they crash into a mountain side . Armies of reptilian Draconian men that turn too stone and explode once they are killed as weapons used to kill them are fused too them . Hey that jacket of Criss pine looks kind of interesting , Imagine limited release clothing in conjunction  upon the release of the movie . Thats video games or a friendly meet up for a table top of  d&d for coffee and snacks on a Saturday once or twice a month . Now good story matters and dragon lance has been on the new york times best selling list several times . Good story is the cake , special effects and big name actors are just the icing . I mean every one is sick of 8 mile , boys in the hood and straight outta Compton , No one wants too see that crap or here about the shit anymore ""Ohhh boo hoo, hooo ...I'm only 12% poor me "" . But something like this will take your mind off the rat race of the week and ""Entertain you"" as well as give you something too look forward to as the ""Entertainment industry should"" , not piss you off. But if the studios started too turn their head in this direction"" $$$$ "". There is ""Dragons of Autumn Twilight "" released in the fall of course , ""Dragons of Winter Night "" the following Christmas season and ""Dragons of Spring Dawning "" that could be relased the proceeding spring of the next year . There lots of television shows that could fill in the gaps between the movies , Such as Kaz the Minotaur . Not to mention  Theo ironfeld wich would be a great role for the rock or Jason mamoa as the charter is black . There is also ""Vampire of The Mist"" with might be a good fit for Robert Pattison .Witch is from the Ravenloft franchise that ties into other mentioned franchises . So there is a lot of things you can do with this dungeons and dragons universe  . I mean lets face it the last three Star Wars movies blew at the box office and Indiana jones ...Ok there old timer , don't get you hip out of joint . But this is something kinda fresh and new , with a built in audience . So this could franchise generate a lot of money both at the big screen and the small screen , But the key word is ""Entertainment "" unlike the nfl and Black lives matters .",True

@AstroPsych_,2022-09-15T17:58:46Z,0,"List of all the D&D content I could find (based on 5e):

[0:22] Black Chromatic Dragon using Acid Breath
[0:43] The red robed figure _really_ looks like the Lich from the Monster Manual
[0:47] Some kind of spell being cast. Based on everything being shattered around the caster, I'm guessing something like _Thunderwave_ or _Shatter_ . The Bard appears to be moving normally through slow motion, so he may be under the effect of _Haste_ or something.
[1:06] Looks like _Thunderwave_ being cast from that crown (also, casting from a magic item rather than your class), ignoring whatever is happening on a larger scale across the city (maybe amplified somehow?)
[1:10] Druid wildshaping from a horse to an Owlbear
[1:25] Bronze or Brass dragon (teal + gold coloration)
[1:26] Druid passes through _Dimension Door_ (not on the Druid spell list, but it's a minor detail, and maybe she didn't cast it)
[1:28] The underdark?
[1:30] _Green Flame Blade_ spell
[1:36] Some kind of lightning spell ( _Witch Bolt_ is my guess, could also be many others)
[1:37] Fireball (possibly from the _Fireball_ spell, possibly just from a catapult) connects with the _Shield_ spell. Technically wouldn't work within rules, since _Shield_ raises your AC and _Fireball_ needs a saving throw, but it's still cool.
[1:42] Mimic!
[1:45] Gelatinous Cube + Displacer Beast. Love that they're using all of these classic monsters straight out of the manual, with designs practically straight out of the book.
[1:46] Probably _Magic Missile_, though technically in the rules _Magic Missile_ is an automatic hit
[1:47]  _Misty Step_

Now for starters im not a d&d player  i play pathfinder 2e and have played a lot of first edition pathfinder aswell.
But i know a d&d due to critical role and other d&d streams.
Hear me out.
Who says the tiefling is a druid?
As far as my limited knowledge goes druids cant cast dimension door (wich i think is the spell cast in the trailer)  there for the tiefling might be a trickery domain cleric or a sorcerer.
There for when she transforms into the owlbear it might just be the polymorph spell no?
Just putting my thoughts out there...

I've seen a lot of movie trailers that have put some sort of music in their trailers, let it be rock, rap, pop, hip hop. You get it, and have failed. I get that the music is supposed to hype us up, but it really shouldn't have been used for the first trailer.

Now what can I say about the trailer? I like the creatures they are using. They are your stereotypical creatures you might use for a D&D Campaign. Which is a good thing. They aren't all the popular choices dms go for. Which is a good thing. I like the party....ish. Michelle Rodrigez playing the strong woman type is typical, but I can't see her playing any other character (Or class), And that's not me marking on her. She's awesome and fits the role perfectly. Chris Pine is fucking perfect as the sleazy bard. I also love the fact that they are focusing on the bard a little bit over the loner type characters most of these movies have. And to be fair, most bards are the leaders of parties so it fits. Overall, Besides the music. looks good. Won't get my hopes up, but I may go see it next year.",True

If this trailer is anything to go by, you're making a generic fantasy movie, and very fundamentally NOT a D&D movie, or any RPG for that matter. If this trailer is accurate, this movie is going to fail HARD.

A true D&D movie is going to be, at best, a comedy action film. Not an action comedy, comedy MUST come first.

A true D&D movie needs stuff like a character dying, followed by the group meeting a character played by the same actor joining them in the next scene (preferably of a similar class). A true D&D movie needs stuff like the characters yelling at the gods that the hordes of enemies they're facing is unfair, followed immediately by one of the enemies fumbling a wand of illusions and most of them disappearing.

10. I don't find it hard to meet expenses. They're everywhere.

 Editorial: Perhaps the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is ""Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway."" It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, ""Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart."" Ever looked with lust? If you have said ""Yes"" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: ""God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com",True

1:07 Paladin maybe?
1:08 Thunderwave spell
1:13 She is a druid (Yes they are playing fast and loose because owlbears are monstrosities but it is really cool)
1:26 We saw that statue at 0:10 so I do not think that is an actual dragon but Animate Object spell
1:27 Dimension Door spell (Now I really think the are fudging for Rule of Cool because druids don't get Dimension Door and I am convinced she hasn't multiclassed enough to get it.)
1:29 50 feet of rope and lanterns because no darkvision.
1:30 That is definitely the underdark
1:31 Green Flame Blade cantrip
1:37 Hard to tell but ?Lightningbolt?
1:38 Definitely not Fire Ball because he can Shield it (Then again might be playing fast and loose)
1:42 (eye twitch) Mimic

I watched Batman recently, and although I do not like violent movies very much, that movie was absolutely well done, it was kept modern with representation from black people in high positions, and just had great graphic quality.  I think this movie could be tolerable, but for the (what I see as) darkly dressed, magic card carrying, D&D crown, I think this missed the mark, and that they could have done better.

@Draeka,2022-07-23T19:21:59Z,1,Looks terrible.  They are literally remaking the original flop of a D&D movie.  With the same formula.  Actors who don't know and don't care about the source material.  Remixed 70s rock that befits a car commercial.  Cringe level comical timing and dad jokes.  Bollywood level CGI.  Talk about schtick layers on schtick.  It is kind of shocking too.  Especially since there is literally a half centuries worth of D&D fantasy lore.  Picking nearly any module and turning it into a script would produce a fantastic plot.  In a funny way the best D&D live action content right now is actually Stranger Things.  The characters and story are more befitting a true D&D campaign.  When an actual D&D movie is served up we always get a mid-page cartoon strip.  I have zero hope for this film.,True

@johnpearson1258,2022-07-23T16:31:40Z,0,"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",True

I hope that the writing and plot is decent, but I am hopeful that it will at least represent what DnD looks and feels like it the minds of the people who play it. I don't care if they get things ""mechanically"" wrong but I appreciate that they are at least representing the different classes and actually have monsters from the game.

@1003JustinLaw,2022-07-23T11:42:53Z,1,"Few things:
- First of all what is that dragon? Tar Dragon? And what's with the other dragons in the trailer? The derpy white dragon and the black dragon that lives in fire? What?
- Besides the dragon BS, I'm glad they're using actual monsters from the game, glad to see the Displacer Beast, Gelatinous Cube, and Mimic getting some big screen time. That said, dodging into a Gelatinous Cube is a REALLY bad idea, I'd personally rather eat the Displacer Beast hit instead.
- Also, and I realize that I'm rules lawyering here, that (I'm going to assume) Druid girl shapeshifting into an Owlbear... Owlbears are monstrosities, neither Wild Shape nor the Polymorth spell can turn someone into a monstrosity, only beasts, so unless she's casting Shapechanger, the bloody 9th-level spell, there's no way she's transforming into an Owlbear. But if she's got access to 9th-level spells, what's she doing getting arrested (I think) by a bunch of normal soldiers? And if you have access to Shapechanger, why Owlbear? The minimum level Druids can have 9th-level spells is 17th level, Shapechanger allows you to transform into any creature whose CR is equal or less than your level, so at the minimum she could transform into a CR 17 thing. What has a CR of 17? Oh I don't know, ADULT RED AND GOLD DRAGONS just to name some examples! An Owlbear's CR is 3, what a waste of a Shapechanger spell if that's actually what it was.
- Next, what is that magic barrier spell? I can't for the life of me think of any Abjuration spell that does whatever it just did.
- And finally, that Mimic, it's not a chest with a tongue, it's a blob disguised as a chest, so it won't clunk into the wall.

That said, I certainly hope the movie does justice to actual D&D and these surface-level complaints I have are just teething problems for cinema's first foray into D&D, at least first in the sense that it's not going to paint D&D as either a Satanic devil-worshipping cult initiation ritual or some corruptive influence that causes psychological problems in the young (like that Mazes and Monsters movie starring Tom Hanks).",True

Message to this world under shadow and deception 2022! 

->

a) Prophecies that show that the bible is the word of almighty creator God:

Isaiah 53; Psalms 16; Micah 5:2; etc.; they say that God the creator will send a savior who will die bearing all the iniquities of all humanity; Psalms 16 says that his soul will not be left in the place of the dead; and Micah 5:2 says that this Savior will be born in Bethlehem, or will come out of there! etc.! All these prophecies according to historical data were written in books written thousands or hundreds of years before Christ Jesus was born! Isaiah 9:6 says:

""For a child is born to us, a son is given to us, and principality upon his shoulder; and his name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.""

Amen!! 

->

b) Science / yet another illusion:

-the theory of evolution: almost all fossils could also be of animals: similar to those of today but now extinct, without evolving; or it could be fossils of deformed animals in their day. Or be hoaxes, like the ""Nebraska Man"" fossil, and the ""Piltdown Man"" fossil; the piltdown one has been believed by the scientific community for about 40 years, and the nebraska one for 10! 

-The big bang theory: it is believed that the earth is millions of years old it is believed: because the rock is very decomposed, or worn out! But for an unknown time the Bible says in Genesis 1, that the entire earth was under water; that broke down the rock; and the flood the fossils. 

->

c) Contradictions in the Bible? There are difficult issues, but search: ""Answered contradictions in the bible 101"", those who want! 

->

d) Catholicism: faithless religion:

-Are they idolaters? 

They say they worship only God, because it would be a sin if they did not do that: Luke 4:8 Jesus replied, ""It is written: 'YOU WILL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND HIM ONLY YOU WILL SERVE. 

-WHAT IS: worship? First according to the institutions: the church is an institution that does not have the right to go against the dictionary: 1Pedr.2:13 ""We submit to every human institution..""! Jeremiah 17:5 ""Cursed is the man who trusts in man"";

-The definition of worship from the RAE Dictionary (Royal Spanish Academy) says:

""1.tr. Revere or worship a being that is considered divine in nature. Worship a single god. Worship God IN his creatures. 2. tr. Worship people or things considered sacred or holy. Worship saint Simon, to the Virgin, the golden calf. 

3.tr...."" ""etc.""! 

-> The point ""2"" shows that they worship the virgin; they are idolaters! 

>>

f) The evil state of the Christian church:

-Read more theology books than the bible, then they are tired to read the Bible: Ecclesiastes 12:12... Women normally wear earrings, rings, necklaces, makeup, etc.; but Isaiah 3: speaks of these things as objects in favor of pride: Is.3:16 Furthermore, the LORD said: ""Because the daughters of Zion are proud And walk with their necks erect, and with seductive eyes, They take short stepsTo make the ornaments tinkle on their feet, ..18 On that day the Lord will remove the apparel of the shoes, and the hair nets, and the lunettes;

19 The necklaces, and the jewels, and the bracelets; 20 The rings, and the jewels of the noses; ..1Pedro 3:3 Your attire is not the external one of ostentatious hairstyles, gold ornaments or luxurious dresses, (any wedding meeting, they usually wear luxury / expensive clothes .. .Example: the suit is by definition luxury/expensive clothing; says the dictionary) -> They will not pray; they do not fast; Matthew 6:5 Matthew 6:16; and they are recorded while they preach in the street they pray etc.: Mateos 6:1 Be careful that you do not do your justice before men..""

The fact that I immediately spotted 5 monsters in this trailer that are relatively unique to D&D, rather than just generic fantasy/mythology creatures. You've got the owlbear (obviously), mimic, displacer beast, gelatinous cube, and a dragon with a non-fire breath weapon. (Black dragon with an acid line breath attack?)

Also, the shield effect that looks like what Eric the Cavalier used to do in the old D&D cartoon.

And lots of other stuff that may or may not be unique to D&D, or just come from generic fantasy. Speaking of which, is satyr a player race in D&D these days?",True

@kenjiwa5895,2022-07-23T00:24:43Z,0,"Interesting trailer, which leaves me in two minds.

First what I struggle with: 
‚Ä¢	The modern phrases (""Here's the thing"") and intonations, which always grate as they seem to come straight out of a Californian teenage movie
‚Ä¢	The ensemble cast that looks a little like an exercise in box-ticking and includes some pretty tiresome clich√©s (the hard-as-nails female character WITH THE DEEP VOICE and attitude, yawn).
‚Ä¢	The fact the characters don‚Äôt really feel appealing. I realise in an ensemble cast you can‚Äôt like them all, but I don‚Äôt relate to any of these. Compare to something like Fell's Five, where characters were a lot less clich√©d and way more appealing.
I suppose I am too old for these, but it‚Äôs a shame to cater to one demographic, rather than be canny and offer something to all age groups and personality types. 

What I really, really like:
‚Ä¢	The worlds, creatures and lore are stunning. 
‚Ä¢	Contrasting environments, amazing beasts and secondary characters.
‚Ä¢	Special effects are genuinely superb and make my heart leap like when I was a teenager and spent hours painting little figurines, playing RPGs or reading fantasy books. 

Not sure whether I‚Äôll go and see it. I fear the Netflix vibe may overcome any pleasure I would derive as an RPG and fantasy fan. But then I may be missing on truly captivating escapism because of a few annoying characters who may turn out to be likeable in the full version.

I know I will be in the minority saying this, but the comic-anime style crazy looking characters and worlds full of color and modern trappings of 3rd edition onwards are for me really goofy and nonsensical. I prefer the grounded art style of 1st and 2nd edition, the attention to medieval sources to describe it's world and themes and the feeling of danger it gave.

@FictionRaider007,2022-07-22T19:08:50Z,1,"Looks better than the 2000 film but that's not exactly difficult (although I'll personally love it in an ironic way even if only for Jeremy Irons hammy acting). Given D&D's rise in popularity recently they've made sure to get some of the more iconic things unique to the tabletop in there (displacer beasts, owlbears, mimics, etc.) which helps more firmly set it as an actual D&D property rather than any other fantasy film. I'll obviously reserve judgement until I see the film but there isn't any major warning signs in the trailer.

Things I'd want to see in a D&D movie but probably won't:
- Cuts to the ""real life"" players sat around the table telling the story, even if only once or twice.
- One of the characters dies and then the same actor shows up playing a new character that joins the party in the next scene (as the player's ""new character"").
- Characters actually using legitimate tactics and moves from the game, maybe even abusing some of them that players also overuse (e.g.: flanking for advantage).
- References to stuff from the older editions before 5e for the die hards.",True

@jacobblack863,2022-07-22T17:46:42Z,0,"''We should never allow bitterness and disappointment to stop us from loving God and other people, The Lord uses the hardship in our lives to help us become better human beings so we can love more deeply and profoundly. The saddest thing we can ever do is to allow those who have harmed us to turn us into exactly what we‚Äôve hated about them''

I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else.
Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be
if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone. 
That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, neglect, cruelty or starvation.
That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown.
I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion
for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of hell ever again.
a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. None of us are righteous, perfect or good (any human who claims that is untruthful with you) 
we have all sinned before God. Everyday we make mistakes
and everyday we sin in word, thought, action and deed, but God loved us so much that he look past our frail human nature and our failures and loved us and wanted to save us anyway despite
 the fact we could never be good or righteous on our own merit. 
Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake
your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever.
''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life''
John 3:16 

""This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth""

@maranatha-lord-jesus6742,2022-07-22T15:45:10Z,0,"""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""   
 -John 3:16
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends
Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.


May God Bless you all",True

This is just a fancy looking fantasy movie with a dnd skin.
(I could be wrong, its just s trailer, but thats what it sure looks like)",True

@Stone7C1,2022-07-22T10:45:52Z,0,"and here we have the perfect example of another movie that should have been animation instead of live action.

what is it with hollywood producers trying to cram these stories into the wrong format? live action comic book and game adaptations rarely ever look even halfway decent because its really hard to translate the medium onto real actors. so why are you repeatedly trying to smash your heads into the wall and keep repeating the same mistake instead of doing something different?

despite what a lot of people say here in the comments that it doesnt look terrible, this looks really fucking dumb and could have looked great if it was fully animated. half of the movie is going to be CGI anyway for the kind of action scenes they are trying to do because theyre really just impossible to do without.

the problem with CGI overloaded live action movies like this here is that one they age really terribly, and two the quality of the animations here doesnt even look good by todays standarts already. imagine they had just made this entire movie in a classic animated 2D format and didnt try to cramp greenscreens and real live actors into this uncanny valley of awkward action scenes where theyre shadow boxing with obvious CGI together.

compare this trailer to the legend of vox machina which is also a modern DnD adaptation to screen, imagine for a second what this movie would look like in a similar format, and youll understand what i mean.",True

Bad casting, bad aesthetics. A D&D movie should feel like being in mordor on the volcano for 90 mins. Where is the dungeons? There should be more monsters, more death, more gloom and fire lit terror. Look at movies that crash and burn, Jungle Cruise, 47 Ronin, they all want to be the bad mummy remake, or clash of the titans. Leaning into cgi, hipster casting, modern hair cuts are all bad choices. You should have something that looks like Agguire The Wrath of God, tired and scared knights, covered in mud and blood, castles that looks like old D&D art work... in fact thats what i really mean, has this director/producer even seen D&D art work or books?

A thief cannot cast spells, and only the highest levelled thieves with maxed out ability scores can handle even the weakest of rods staves and wands. Scrolls have to be read allowed, not held, and generally take a turn, which is 6 minutes not 6 seconds. In aDD, it's actually an hour.  And finally, in the players handbook, the number 1 cliche meme is, ""there is NO honor among thieves."" The theif is the guy the party brings along, reluctantly, because they need him to open locks and disarm traps in ancient runes.  This tends to cause paladins to kill them when they commit evil acts or lose their powers when they don't. It's a major contention point in DD designed to cause inner party turmoil for the purpose of social interaction at the table. DD is not about a party of theives.",True

While I  am happy to finally see a descent production of a DD movie this is still not right. The last movie was centered on a thief, or what could be more described as a fighter/thief and it's successor had the cleric killed off right att he beginning.  I chalked this up to production costs and lack of technology.  However, we have Superman flying around now and all sorts of visual effects today.  DD is not about a bunch of thieves...it is about a party of heroic adventurers battling a force of evil or braving some ancient ruins to gather power to battle some force of evil. When will they make an actual DD movie that features the party as it is intended to be?  A fighter, paladin, ranger, cleric, wizard and thief.  One theif, not 5, as they would die right off without a healer.  All mmo players know this, in fact, all video game players know this as video games are based off of DD.",True

So i guess my expectation for this movie is to be on vox machina's level.

I literally looked on a generic movie title generator and got some names this could've easily had:

Flameborn
Den of Monsters

@Badwolf0683,2022-07-21T21:21:41Z,118,"Since so many people keep on commenting the same thing:

Circle of the Moon Druids can become Owl Bears. With DM approval and it's quite commonly allowed. The reason it isn't is because it's classified as a Monstrosity. Where Druid's wildshape into beasts. The reason for the Monstrosity is because the Owl Bear was originally labeled as a creation from a mad wizard.   Yet cannon changed it as a natural creature. However, the label wasn't changed. Depending on your DM you either use the older origins or the one more accepted in modern canon. So Yes a druid can wildshape into an owlbear. 

 ""However, the oldest elves recalled that owlbears had been around for many millennia and a few fey claimed owlbears had always been found in the Feywild.[1] In fact, owlbears were brought into being by one of the creator races,[11] most likely the aearee"". Their stat bloc is also very close to a strong Cave Bear with similarly low intelligence. 

So the reason the Owl Bear isn't allowed is due to the lore that it was created by a wizard. Yet recent lore suggests that was a myth and not the case.",True

The D&D IP has become a joke anyway, so I guess this is appropriate, since WoTC can't make good use of it. I'm not going to put my money on this one, will watch it in a stream platform when it become available and if I have nothing better to do.

@jedijones,2022-07-21T20:43:58Z,0,"God, when will they STAHHHHP giving every single special effects action adventure movie the same tone as Guardians of the Galaxy? OVER IT! This brand is crying out for the dark, serious tone a director like Chris Nolan or Zack Snyder would bring to it. This rock and roll romp style feels as lame, tired, inappropriate and underwhelming as it did in Star Trek: Beyond and Thor: Ragnarok.

I kind of like how the cast is slightly fashioned after the look of the 1980s cartoon characters. They should've gone with that plot though. Because I cannot follow what's going on in this trailer at all. It needs to be grounded. Having these be kids coming from Earth trying to figure out this world would give the audience its entry point.

Peak Dungeons & Dragons right there.,True
@SuperWoodgod,2022-07-21T20:42:20Z,15,"I'm pleasantly surprised they're actually fully embracing the more out-there side of D&D, and that they've included the mimic, owlbear, and gelatinous cube.

Honestly, when I heard they were making a D&D movie, I was expecting something along the lines of a ""serious fantasy"" ala Game of Thrones (albeit with more powerful magic). I thought they'd only stick with the typical fantasy creatures like orcs, giants and dragons, which would be easier for a mainstream audience to swallow, and that they'd only hint at the weirder elements, or possibly wait until a sequel to introduce them. And I would have been fine with it if they decided to go that route, but what they're doing here is the kind of tone I wanted them to go with, so I'm definitely looking forward to this.

In terms of quality, I'm not expecting LOTR, but if they can manage something at least as decent as Pirates of the Caribbean or Guardians of the Galaxy, I'll be more than happy.",True
