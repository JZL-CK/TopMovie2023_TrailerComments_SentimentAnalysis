@redindian8344,2024-02-15T18:03:41Z,3,"My guess points :
1. The mother is guilty
2. The child lied at the beginning during the reenactment to protect his mother (he changed his mind)
3. he lied again at the end of the trial, my perspective is seeing the director's way of conveying it with the way the father speaks in his son's voice, making it look like a lie being voiced by his son
4. maybe with the long trial process, he thought that rather than losing both of his parents, he chose to lie (as his guard said: it's better to decide by speaking as if it were true)
5. At the end of the film, the child kisses his mother as if the child is protecting his mother and his mother thanks him without saying it, because his mother seems to have a high ego when listening to the recording (with the flashback)",True

Snoop is a legend.  Woof!",True
@elainegmorrison,2024-02-11T23:47:32Z,3,"Good movie. It held your interest. Interesting how they turn everything into a clue while you don't know where it points to. The characterization is the real essence of the movie, with the mother as the cold egotistical father, the father as the self-appointed woe is me mother, the lawyer as the amorous unrequited suitor shmuck, and the kid as just plain creepy. Nobody else got that vibe? And while everyone was focused on the mother whom they did not particularly like, or the father who obviously was tired thanklessly giving to this world, nobody was looking at the blind kid who could do just about anything and eventually poisoned his dog.
The mother made the world revolve around her, also regarding her partner's death. Selfish, cold, unwavering. When she ceased being the centre of attention she felt the let down of her court victory. The father did need a change to what he had set up, but he was also full of excuses and self pity for his lack of professional action. Violent, manipulative, passive aggressive. If he is a writer, why is he drowning the household with loud music? There was a court appointed guardian, and I don't have a real opinion about her. She saved the dog, assisted in barring the mother from her own home, abandoned the kid quite a bit for the guardian of a blind boy. The only likeable character was the dog. And as with all black sheep, he was duly punished for his noble babysitter duties by being overdosed by his charge. I can't forget the exhausted look of the herder barely managing to walk behind the son, then leaving him to eventually place himself in bed with the mother instead. The father is dead. The mother was on trial. The lawyer and babysitter go home alone, and the dog made his choice where it was safe to rest. I think we all know by this time there was more to the poisoning/suicide story than what the characters had said. It's not what you say. We're watching what you do.",True

 He also change his opinion very early on the movie when he said he was inside the house instead under the window outside, there were many reasons why i feel the  mother actually is guilty though as you see on the move  nothing is completely clear and leave you with you own interpretation of what truly was what happened  on that moment although in my opinion even with all that i still hold that based on the context that happened and  some clues kinda make me certain that was guilty ,",True
