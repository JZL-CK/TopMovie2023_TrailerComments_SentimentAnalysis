Baba Yaga is kind of an old hag forest witch who likes to snack on kids. Baba literally means a woman. It sounds so stupid it's cringe. I bet they thought it sounded like a bogeyman, and there is a character exactly analogous used to scare little kids called Babay. 
Ok, BUT there is another fairytale character called Kashchey, or in full Kashchey the Undying. He is a king - tall, slim, dressed in black with a long hair, he commands death and cannot be killed by regular means. Reminds of someone from this movie?
Given Russian speaking actors in the movie it's double stupid. Those are fairitales every kid knows, it's not an obscure lore. They should definetely know that Baba Yaga is an absolute miss.",True

@withgreatvengeance7451,2024-02-12T03:42:02Z,0,I've watched this movie like 50 times and enjoyed just as much as the last 3 it's just so friggin entertaining. But something was different about this one I feel they went a little Over board and at times you can tell some scenes were rushed the nunchucks scene you can tell they couldn't get it quite perfect so they went with what keanu was able to pull off it was still Kool though there were a few other scenes I won't get into. Donnie Yens character Caine was a little ridiculous N a bit over the top like the way he rubbed the handle of his cane after placing motion detectors around the Chefs kitchen things like that just too much. I hope chapter 5 they take their time with and deliver us with something that even John wick has trouble with maybe going up against an assassin just as good as he is. I guess we'll see,True

John is indestructible; he fell from a 4 floor building, a 222 step stairs, was being run over several times by cars and bikes but our man keeps on running and fighting. He even survives an attack by an huge army of heavily armed criminals. Fortunately John is wearing a bulletproof costume so he can hide his head in his jacket whenever needed.

Honestly, even though I enjoyed them, there were way too many (and too long) fight sequences in this film that didn't jive well w the bland story line!

What  I found odd  and mising was  that JW didn't have a ""sniper rifle"" yet he wa an  ""elite level assassin"".  I'm guessing  the  ""sniper rifle"" would be the 41  weapon for an  ""assassin""??  To be good at not being seen....like a  ""ninja""  SHOULD be...""neither seen nor heard""....as much as spossible.  Even int he  Jason Bourne films they did have  JB behind the scoe of a sniper rifle--CHECK. 

Assassins I'd think would also be masters of diguise.....

Only problem i had with JW1---the Russian mob  just walked into JW's ""lair""...unheard. Shuld be layers upon layers of  traps and alarms...and seceral quick escapes for JW....and to  beat him within an inch of his life  in thebeginning???  How was he going to recover  to do the rest of the film??   H should have been  handicapped after that beating if not killed...if not killed forced to do his kills from a distace--snipr rifle...no way he'd be able to  ""hand to hand""..etc.

@22leggedsasquatch,2023-08-24T01:14:23Z,2,"A terrible final chapter in the trilogy. I would say i'm disgusted and if it were possible, I would want my money back. The audience has been truly cheated. This was not even 15% of either of the first 2 installments and a true insult to them. The ONLY HIGHLIGHT was the DOG.

The director destroyed the brand and should never be supported with this genre again. EVERY fight scene was so poor, that it could have been made by a clueless beta-male who knows ZERO about hand-to-hand combat. Enemies making a move, then freezing, so that Wick could finish them.  It was PURE McDojo Bullshit, and the 'Ken Doll bodyguards' in grey were complete overkill and deserving only of derision. CGI was used to an obnoxious extent and the storyline was so poor and lacking any viewer engagement, that if it were a free film, I would have stopped watching after the first ridiculous 30 minutes. A cheaply made studio green-screen film, that was quickly written on a Friday afternoon. Shame on Keanu Reeves for accepting it.

He came to save us from sin's damnation and cure us from it's curse and set us free from it's bondage and give us life, healing, freedom and forgiveness and redemption and salvation by Him and His Holy Spirit ( Luke 4:18-19)! Jesus went as the lamb of God and made Himself as a sacrificial offering for our sins, He went and took all of our sins and God's wrath on the cross, He took God's Holy hatred that was for us because of our sins and He took that for us on the cross even though He was and is innocent and we was and are guilty! Jesus never sinned, He kept all of God's Holy law and never broke one ( Matthew 5:17, 1 Peter 2:22) but we didn't do like Christ, we human beings disobeyed God and ate the forbidden fruit, we brought sin into the world because of our disobedience towards God our Holy Heavenly Creator and Father! but Jesus took all of our guilt, shame, sin to the cross and suffered God's wrath, our punishment, our sins for us on that cross and all the pain, insults, and beatings He went through could not dare compare to God's wrath He went through and yet what's astounding about this is that He didn't have to do it He didn't have to take you and my sin to the cross He didn't have to suffer our punishment for us, He could have called a legion of Holy angels and have us destroyed, He could have went back to Heaven and we all perished in our sins But BUT Because of His love and mercy He has for us He went through it all on the cross and died and paid for our sin debt and penalty in full, He  the rose again on the third day with glory and power and triumph and conquered hell, sin, death, satan, and the world and broke down the wall that separated us from the Him. we are unworthy of all that Jesus did for us but He did it for us anyway! that is true love and that same true love is calling all sinners to repentance. Jesus is the only way to Heaven and Salvation and He has His hand out offering salvation and forgiveness of sin and redemption to everyone, Let's pray they'll answer His call and come to Him and turn from their sin and turn to Him for salvation, forgiveness of sin and redemption that He offers to everyone everyday and that the same people will surrender their all to Him and become born again by the Holy Spirit ( John 3:3-8, John 14:6) Amen",True

I am in love with the 4th one. You outdid yourselves. Everything is so stellar I'm just at a loss of words and almost cried at points out of sheer amazement of your work. The first one was my favorite, then the second one, then the third one, and now this one. I don't even know how you keep on improving and finding unique takes on the series. I love your work. I also immensely love the blind guy starting in on the action at the beginning. It was so slick. This movie felt like something more than a movie and I've never said that in my life. I kept on watching the third one over and over while waiting for this one. I actually waited to watch this one because I was savoring the moment as odd as that sounds.

@willbrink,2023-06-25T14:48:23Z,3,"I don't think any movie series demonstrates style over substance like the Wick franchise. The first one was a lot of fun and well done. After that it's just been highly stylized ultra choreographed fight scenes that find new ways to kill people. JW4 takes that yet another level with axes, arrows, bladed of all kinds, incendiary rounds, etc, etc. There's literally no plot other than same plot, he has to work his way up the food chain of bad guys to be free.

Some of the visuals are outstanding and entertaining, some were clunky and some poor CGI showed itself. I found the blind swordsmen trope ruined by this movie, and the need for the suspension of disbelief turned to max to keep watching it. From all that you'd think I didn't like this movie.

In the genre of mindless ultra violent fun over the top fight scenes, it's a good movie. Fans of the franchise will not be disappointed. I'm over those kinda of movies at this point and I think in the genre of utterly over the top ultra violent movies with great (and I do mean great!) amazing fight scenes, yet has humor, character development, etc, done for a fraction of the cost, Hardcore Henry is my pick.

Wick (and most of the other combatants) get shot many many times, to NO effect! I get how their suits are a kevlar weave, but seriously?! To be that effective, they'd have to be wearing Ironman's armour!! And a blind assassin?! Keanu's acting is very wooden. Always has been. But no new dialogue at all ""i need a gun"" :) At nearly 60yrs of age, Keanu is still reasonably competent at the hand-to-hand fighting stunts. But he was noticably less so in this movie.

Shot to the head, falls off a roof, cracks his head and neck on a dumpster at the bottom...it is simply not possible to recover from that, so they ignore it. Some weak nod to Fishburne is not enough, and that blemishes the movie from the start as there are no real physical consequences for John. The guy shouldn't be walking yet after the end of the original, let alone this, so that ruins the movie from the start. Too bad, but they shouldn't have ended Parabellum so viciously; and enough with dogs on command as killers in these films, too. He had a sweet puppy of hope, not a grown KP partner, in the original. It's insulting to see how much the love of a dog and his redemption has been tarnished here. As for blind men with guns and how they get around in new places with gunfire everywhere, not even Donnie Yen is that good.

With John Wick, I've got bored after the second part, seems that, the hero had endless resources of physical and mental resources (not to mention luck, guns and ammo) and the armies of top assassins sent to eliminate him will always fail, individual and collective. What could possible challenge him? John Wick against Predator? Against Tanos? I had to go through another two sequels for what? John Wick dies and goes next to his wife? He could have spared himself (and us) of all the trouble by putting a bullet in his head, ad least he would not have died tired. And Winston? After all this fuss, took his hotel back and the life of assassin's host right from where he left it? So, if he will have another brush with High Table,  can start all over again?

In all the cop shows, one bullet to a vest knocks a guy out but here just pull the lapel over your face and whalla, dont even pop a blood vessel. Still good entertainment.

The movie starts with Shimazu Akira, the daughter of his friend. She's in big trouble and many people are after her. She john wicks her way through the first half of the movie, but she needs help. And she believes that john wick faked his death. She spends a portion of the movie looking for him. She finds him and manages to convince him to help him. The end is an epic half hour j0hn wick vs the table and ends with john killing the table members with help of course but he dies protecting shimazu. It will be nice having john fight for something other than vengeance and freedom",True

@user-tt7uo6js7b,2023-05-01T16:44:38Z,1,"It’s been out for a while now but I finally got to see this yesterday. Don’t get me wrong I loved it, its one of the most spectacular action movies I’ve ever seen and I didn’t feel awkward with the high body count as everyone is a hitman/woman or working with them and John fights in self defence. 

However its sooo far fetched and ridiculous how much he survives and can carry on fighting and some of the main characters. Noone in this is a cyborg, alien or superhero or supervillain. He gets knocked off the bonnet of more than one car and is fine, gets kicked down several feet onto a concrete floor and is okay, falls through a glass window on the third floor of a townhouse onto a car roof and gets up ok! An assassins dog gets hit by a car and bumps off the bonnet and gets up and runs off! 

A big fight develops in a Berlin night club dance floor and its ages before anyone acknowledges it and they evacuate. John goes into a Russian Orthodox Church and gets blasted with a shotgun by obviously a fake priest and John is fine! When things kicks off in Berlin and Paris including amongst the traffic you don’t see any police at all. There’s a guy whose a hitman whose lost his sight but manages to fight perfectly and shoot a gun in exactly the right direction just going on hearing. It’s crazy but if you liked the other films or stuff like this you have to see it. 5/5",True

Sincerely and with honesty. His job is being an actor, which is artistic in it's nature. Celebrity brings pressure along with the glitz that folks seem to see the most of, because we all like fairy tales. Keanu has used his name and good fortune to better the world, no matter what. His life has not been easy or was handed to him, by any means. Like the song written by Israel Houghton, ""One""...... he's a good soul and is using his abilities on earth the best way anyone could. We all want to be happy, but, life doesn't owe us anything. Thank you, Keanu, for putting us in a better place and for making it known, we can learn to fly again after our wings were broken.

@davidnyro19,2023-04-13T05:45:11Z,1,"""John Wick 5, the Final Chapter"" anyone? Winston and Bowery King were entirely too unmoved at the end, though it's true they're not known for wearing their emotions on their sleeves. And Bubba being there didn't mean anything. In fact, if Wick was really there, in the ground, perhaps the dog would've pawed the grave? But what a way to fade away and find peace? Wick's death is terribly convenient, allowing him to go off somewhere, with a new identity, to live off the grid, find his peace, blah-blah. (Of course that's only the plot of every third movie like this, especially Westerns.)
Side bar: LOVED the set piece shot from above, going room-to-room. The blaster gun, igniting the baddies, was sick! But I was waiting for him to blast one guy and then we see the force of the shot send the flaming bad guy rolling into a large fireplace where he's basically a large burning log! LOL!!! I think it would've brought the house down in the packed theatre where I saw the film. They were already howling and cheering other places.

@darylwong6435,2023-04-09T05:27:33Z,1,"Hoping to get a spin-off movie for Tracker to expand into the Payday gang (more hitman in sleek suits) >.>

If anyone of you are following the ""Payday"" game lore, which interestingly John Wick is a acquaintance to the Payday Gang, Wick and a particular character Nicolas, alias ""Chains"", were former comrades during their time in the military. Which would explain why Mr Nobody would know of John's antics and tactics in greater detail than any other regular tracker would to demand such a high compensation for his service. And also, the video showed how Mr Nobody, similar to John, wore his watch facing inwards suggesting military background. So why would John possibly not recognize Mr Nobody? Possibly because they were just former comrades and not exactly friends, and according to the Payday lore Nicolas a.k.a ""Chains"" due to  his itchy trigger finger and generally unreliable personality caused him to get kicked out fairly fast. Chains had then left the Navy and went into the world of mercenary troops, offering his military expertise to the highest bidder << which was basically what he was doing in the movie. It is possible ""The Tracker"" could have a spin off film to expand on this since in the Payday lore Wick eventually resurfaces after a time of ""going dark"" to lend Chains (and his buddies) a hand. And this could be really exciting if they slowly bring in more hitman in suits i.e. the Payday gang comprising of ""Dallas"", ""Hoxton"", ""Wolf"" and ""Chains"" himself with a lot of depth in their backstory. And to support this, if you look back at John Wick 2 or search ""John Wick Payday easter egg"" on google, you will see an snippet off the film with 2 clown masks behind the extra; and the more prominent clown mask you see?.. is Chains.",True

Yes, some might think it a big deal but having a disability I must use a wheelchair cabs and u need to book them, or u wait hour or so before u get another one.
The movie doesn't continue from Chapter 3. There is a lot missed out from the story line from John Wick 1 through to 3 but 4 there is a long jump in the story from 3 to 4. He was shot out of the window Winston at the Continental New York and ends up on the ground after falling out a window picked up by Tick Tock taken to Bowery King tipped out of a trolly in front of Bowery wounded and ended at that point. John Wick starts 7 years in the future and u don't have any idea what happened to John Wick in the 7 years at the start of Chapter 4. The way John Wick dies didn't seem real, he got stabbed but he sits down on the step and falls over then you are at his funeral.",True

""Goodbye to you, my trusted friend"" could be a reference to Caine - one of his old friend

So that lyrics synced it well. Then 0:54 ""Please pray for me"" and ""I was the black sheep of the family""
Sang when he walked to his old family, synced again. And the ""Goodbye, my friend, it's hard to die""

The action sequences had some obvious flaws and felt a bit repetitive, almost like the director ran out of ideas on how to kill a man with a gun.  Some dudes did a backflip after getting shot in the head, which seemed a bit obviously fake.  There's also a scene where the guy getting hit by JW is so delayed in falling over that I looked around in the cinema to see if anyone else noticed it cause it felt so fake.  Other than some obviously bad choreographed scenes, two of the newly introduced characters fell very flat.  Especially Bill Skarsgard's villian.  Anyways, still a great popcorn action movie!  I think I went in with way too high expectations and maybe thats why I didn't enjoy it that much.  JW3 has to be my fav.",True

@1anunaki,2023-03-21T17:03:41Z,0,"In New York City, John Wick prepares to exact his revenge against the High Table while hiding underground with the Bowery King. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder, the only individual above the High Table.

Because of this, New York Continental Hotel manager Winston Scott and his concierge, Charon, are summoned to the Marquis Vincent de Gramont, a senior member of the High Table, who chastises Winston for his failure to assassinate John.[a] To punish Winston, de Gramont strips him of his duties as manager, has the Continental destroyed, and kills Charon. He then travels to Paris and enlists Caine, a blind, retired High Table assassin and old friend of John's, to kill him, threatening to murder Caine's daughter otherwise.

John takes refuge at the Osaka Continental, which is run by his friend Shimazu Koji. De Gramont's assassins, led by his right-hand man Chidi, arrive along with Caine to kill John. Akira, Koji's daughter and the hotel's concierge, orders the hotel evacuated, and joins her father, John, and the hotel's staff in fighting off the High Table's assassins. Akira is wounded, while Koji tells John how to escape. On his way out, John fights off another wave of assassins, followed by Caine. They are interrupted by a tracker pursuing John for a contract, nicknamed ""Mr. Nobody"" by de Gramont, but he lets John go after deciding the contract money is insufficient. Akira also escapes, but Koji is killed by Caine.

John returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon's gravesite. Winston suggests that John challenge de Gramont to a duel, as winning will free him of his obligation to the High Table. Per the Table's traditions, John can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family; seeing as he previously severed his ties to the Ruska Roma,[a] John travels to their headquarters in Berlin to receive a new crest marking his membership to the syndicate. His adoptive sister Katia agrees to do so in exchange for killing Killa, a German High Table senior who murdered her father.

John finds and kills Killa in his nightclub. Katia then brands John's arm with a Ruska Roma crest, enabling John to formally request a duel with de Gramont through Winston, who requests the New York Continental rebuilt with him reinstated as manager as part of his terms should John win. In Paris, John and de Gramont decide the parameters of their duel, in a meeting moderated by the Harbinger, the Table's emissary. De Gramont nominates a reluctant Caine to fight in his place. The duel is to take place the following sunrise at Sacré-Cœur; the Harbinger informs John that both he and Winston will be executed should he fail to appear on time.

The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a weapon and a new ballistic suit. De Gramont attempts to prevent John from arriving to the duel by placing a $40 million contract on his head. John fights off hordes of assassins on his way to Sacré-Cœur, including Mr. Nobody, but the latter stops hunting John after he saves Mr. Nobody's dog from being killed by Chidi. Caine aids John in fighting his way up the stairs leading to the Sacré-Cœur; Chidi nearly kills John, but Mr. Nobody kills him first.

John and Caine narrowly reach the summit in time to save Winston. The two duel with pistols; Caine gravely wounds John in the first two rounds. De Gramont asks to personally execute John for the final round, but John, who had not yet fired his gun, shoots and kills de Gramont. The Harbinger declares him free of his debt to the High Table, though John dies peacefully due to his wounds.

After Winston is reinstated as manager of the Continental, he and the Bowery King attend John’s funeral, having buried him next to his late wife Helen. Sometime later, Akira approaches Caine, seeking to avenge her father's death.",True

@ivancarroll7853,2023-03-18T17:18:41Z,5,This is one of the RARE film franchises that if given the opportunity I would watch 1-4 in sequence in a theater. having breakfast lunch and dinner while polishing off a Bottle of Blanton's (john wicks' favorite bourbon whisky). This franchise was such a well written and constructed storyline endearing us to one of the most violent sociopathic killers who found true love but lost it tragically and will do everything possible to just to remember that love. Remembering it created the most incredible fight choreography ever put together in film (Hats off to John woo Gun-Foo style )adapted by fight scene coordinator Jonathan Eusebio. Reeves training in both Japanese and Brazilian  Jiu-Jitsu translated well to the Krav Maga style used most dominantly in the fight scenes throughout the franchise. With the recent death of Lance Reddick it is a bitter sweet final performance but likely one that will be forever etched in history as generations of movie goers will watch this franchise for many years into the future. I plan to watch all three just before I head to the silver spot (dine in theater) in Atlanta to watch #4 and they better have some Blanton's Bourbon whiskey to sip while I watch.,True

@ZakEmber,2023-03-11T19:25:36Z,1,"You know, this film series has definitely morphed into something pretty different than the original film... kind of like The Fast and The Furious... but in a good way. It's gotten bigger, it's gotten more epic, it's a bit more cheesy, but it's still John Wick. Unless they jump the shark by sending him into space or taking out tanks with Mustangs like the Fast series, I think John Wick is set up for a nice, final chapter.",True

It’s still never been stated what killed her, only that she became ill and passed away from what may have been cancer.

To me, ""John Wick is definately a man with a Heart (❤️).""

In this world there is no gray middle ground. A women is either pregnant, or not, it can not be both. A man either speaks the truth or not, there is no middle territory. We either serve the kingdom of Heaven, The Lord of Peace, or the Lord of this world who feeds on violence, killing, aggression baptised among others as ""action movies"". Think of Alec Baldwin...! We each have to make a choice, there is no middle ground in the spiritual world. We need to chose to either serve God or be the Devil's Advocate. And by not making a choice, a choice is made for you.

Buongiorno Keanu Reeves,
Sono Sibila Malara e sono stata vittima di mobing e violazione dei diritti di privacy personale e di proprietà intellettuale da più di 10anni perseguitata da keanu reeves e I sui colleghi registi e amicizie attoriale femminili che hanno rubato le mie idee e hanno fatto videogiochi soldi con franchising di John wick e berserk e a oggi non mi hanno dato nessun soldi e loro si continuano a arricchire con la mia immagine e a farsi pubblicità .Questi e una serie di reati fanno si che ho sporto denuncia per arresto a loro e questo ha provocato gravi danni irreparabili anche a chi mi stava intorno:fidanzati  ,amici e i miei parenti a rischio .Diffido dal continuare o avrete denunce di arresto sia negli usa che in altri paesi del mondo .
Prego di smetterla perché questo è pari a uccidere i diritti umani .

Tutti sanno questa vergogna e lo continueranno a sapere perché chi non fa nulla di male non può essere attaccato in questo modo .

Make your art right,well that’s for yourself.

Like they know everything but they don’t know nothing.
This is persecution for free.
This can be scam.

Don’t worry for me I’m continuingly evolving my art,my art is always reliable. We can call this hyper concrete real multipliable magic.
A part of this this is an other kind of movies,I think that they are restarting the bad or movies not good enough series. But there is already a lot like this.
On new movies they put lot more content,lot of great content or spectacular content either but if you put not enough from these this will become not very good to view.
Just like the Matrix series compared to the new ideology of more content on the new movies.

All stores,companies,enterprises are trying to crook me,selling me this over kind of stuffs,hihhhhhhhhhhh!
(I’m too important)(just joking)
I won’t buy movies until long long time.

When they talk or act they representing all the movies industry,it’s not all of them that do this.
To stop them would be to save them.
Well girls don’t even care cause they won’t watch those movies or doesn’t like this cause they are more sensitive than men.

In chapter three the pretty much best one to one fight was with the guy from Raid 2 as in that the baddie in the kitchen fight scene which is RiDiculous scene. Then again stunt-men who can direct knows what to do + I know Reeves has contacts to atleast some of the martial artists too.

Like say Jackie Chan's Hong Kong movies, many times he or Sammo Hung were directing and knew not to play with the camera too much so you see the action. Then Jackie came into US, didn't get to do some stunts which he wanted and ok for that (liability and insurance things) but the style of cut cut cut is stupid. The stunt looks way less impressive that way than a good camera placement. After Jason Bourne, goddamn the shaky camera and cutting waay too much came it's own fad that ended into Taken 3 that isn't even watchable anymore. Ofcourse Liam Neeson isn't Reeves condition but it was ridiculous and you build the script around what he can do convincingly and what can be masked with stunt-men.",True

It's just painful & idk why people like it so much. I like Reeves, but come on. Anyway.. that's my hot take, get all butthurt about it.",True

A guy kills people who killed his wife's dog (that she gave him as a gift before she died) then avoids getting killed and kills people who wanna kill him for killing the people who killed his wife's dog. That's it. That's the basic plot of the John Wick franchise. Also can they let Lance Reddick get away from that desk and be cool for once?? They gave him a little moment in Chapter 3 they need to ride that momentum and give his character a better role in the movies. I probably won't be seeing Chapter 4",True

@halleluyah4191,2022-11-13T19:13:14Z,0,"*Imagine, if you died right now, where would your soul go for eternity? Was everything you ever did without purpose, and never really mattered, or will you just stop existing, after you draw your last breath? Think about this, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real, place of eternal bliss, peace, and perfection. Hell is real, place of eternal suffering, torment, and agony. You’re going to spend your eternity in one of those places. God's will is, that nobody would perish. One day, each and every one of us must appear before The Judgement Seat of The Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our life. The only way to get to Heaven is, if you’ve never broken any part of The God’s Law, in other words, if you’re without sin, and every single one of us have sinned. Not one person, who’s not born again from above, of The Holy Spirit of God, and is still in their sins, can inherit The Kingdom of God, for the wages of sin is death, and eternal damnation. Our sins separates us from God.*
 
*But The Heavenly Father in His love and mercy, sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins. He left Heaven’s Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by The Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a holy perfect life while being in same temptations as we are, yet without sin, was condemned unjustly to death, although being innocent, was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf, for there is no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood, but Christ, The spotless and unblemished Lamb of God, The Final Perfect Sacrifice once and for all, took the punishment of our sins on the cross, sacrificed Himself for us and paid the sin debt in full, past, present, and future, so we can be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God, after the fall in Paradise by satan's tempting, through The Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Calvary, in His everlasting love towards every single one of us.*
 
*If you truly repent, confess your sins, and ask for forgiveness of all your sins from The Lord Jesus Christ, The Holy One of Israel, and believe with all your heart, that Jesus Christ of Nazareth, The Messiah, The Son of The one and only True Living God, was crucified at Calvary, died on the cross for our sins, was buried, rose from the dead by God’s power on the third day according to The Holy Bible, and by faith receive Him as your Lord and Savior, through The Holy Royal Blood of Jesus Christ you will be saved, and are born again from above, of The Holy Spirit of God. Every sin that weighs down your inner being, even the ones you never dare to speak of, will be forgiven. Repent, believe, follow Christ, and you will spend your eternity in Heaven with our Holy Almighty God, where is no more death, sorrow, pain nor crying.*
 
*John 3:16 – For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son (Jesus Christ), that whosoever believeth in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.*
 
*John 14:6 – Jesus saith unto him: ''I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No man cometh unto The Father (to Heaven), except by Me.''*
 
*John 6:47 – (Jesus said unto them:) ''Verily, verily, I say unto you: He that believeth on Me, hath everlasting life.''*
 
*The Book of Acts 4:12 – Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men (only Jesus Christ), whereby we must be saved.*
 
*Romans 10:9-10 – That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth The Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.*
 
*Romans 10:13 – For whosoever shall call upon the name of The LORD (Jesus Christ), shall be saved.*
 
*Romans 8:1-2 – There is therefore now no condemnation to them, which are in Christ Jesus, (born again from above, of The Holy Spirit of God, who walk not after the flesh, but after The Holy Spirit.) For the law of The Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sin and death.*
 
*Ephesians 2:8-10 – For by grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them. (According to The Holy Bible, salvation is completely, entirely, and 100% by faith in Jesus Christ, by His mercy, and work of the cross. God sees us worthy in Christ. We can’t earn it by our good deeds, and we’re not kept saved by our good deeds. God’s will is, that we’d do them, but He has given us free will.)*
 
*Titus 3:5 – Not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to His mercy, He (Christ) saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of The Holy Spirit.*
 
*Isaiah 1:18 – ''Come now, and let us reason together, saith The LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.''*
 
*1. Timothy 2:5 – For there is one God, (God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), (Jacob = Israel), and one Mediator between God and men, The Man Christ Jesus. (There is only one God, in three different Persons: The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit. This is called; The Holy Trinity. There are not three different Gods, but only one God, in three different Persons.)*
 
*The Book of Revelation 1:8 – (Jesus Christ said:) ''I am The Alpha and The Omega, The Beginning and The Ending, says The Lord God; who is, who was, and who is to come, The Almighty.'' (The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.)*
 
*1. Peter 5:8 – Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking, whom he may devour.*
 
*John 10:10 – (Jesus said unto them:) ''The thief (satan) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come, that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.''*
 
*Ephesians 6:12 – For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.*
 
*The Book of Revelation 22:12 – (The Lord Jesus Christ said:) ''And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according, as his work shall be.''*
 
*The LORD bless you, and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.*
 
*In Jesus Christ Holy, Royal, and Mighty Name, Amen.*",True

Those 2 in the additional cast you already know the fight scenes are going to be off the scale.  Much respect to giving Scott Adkins a role in a film of this magnitude, I've only seen him in Top rated B-movies but his talent in fight scenes is undeniable.  The only name missing is Michael Jae White (Blood and Bone) even fought against Yuri Boyka in Undisputed 2 from which he was the reason Yuri's leg was broken, either way im overly looking forward to this.

It's nothing new. It reminds me of the joke a comedian named Pablo Francisco who said all of Jackie Chan's movies are about him trying to be left alone, but people keep attacking him and he ends up beating them up and then says ""Leave me alone!""

@olusegun.b.olofin5278,2022-11-13T07:33:26Z,13,"Keanu Reeves have evolved throughout the years of martial arts right from the Matrix franchise to John Wick Franchise . How he does it at his age fills me with so much awe of excitement . Keanu is inspiring me more to do martial arts and also his acting is intact . 

Much more to Donnie Yen who from the first time I watched him in Tiger Cage 2 to the IP man franchise inspires me deeply . After Bruce Lee, and Jackie Chan and Jet Li, Donnie Yen moves me with so much energy . 

Scott Adkins , I love his kicks and energy. His 540 kicks is my favourite. And I want to see more of him in top notch movies and more of him in the lead acts . 

Undisputed 3 is my favourite of the undisputed movie franchise . Ninja and Ninja shadow of  a tear are wonderful movies .

Both lost the person they loved that connected them to a good life and after that really just existed. I predict John will die in this one. I can't see him living unless he finds something worth living for and it seems to make sense in this world. John didn't have an innocent life. We know him as the broken man who lost his wife and the puppy but we dint know the lives he taken before that,and perhaps he gets what he deserves. Also I think that ""ill be seeing you soon john"" thing his enemies say before he dies alludes to that. Not in some grand conspiracy thing but because they eventually die in this lifestyle.",True

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.

2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:
1. Romans 5:9
2. Romans 3:23
3. Romans 6:23
4. Romans 10:9
5. Romans 10:13
6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9
7. John 3:16

@jamesdigeorgia6112,2022-11-13T02:12:09Z,2,"Keanu's martial arts scenes are superb. I played Judo starting at the age of six and became a national U.S. champion at 14 and 15, eventually earning a Nidan from the toughest Japanese instructors in Japan.. I also studied Japanese Karate under 7-time world champion Grand Master Sensei Miyazaki Hachidan from 9-14 and would go to the Dojo whenever I could while visiting NY until I was 36. I also studied Jujitsu under the greatest Jujitsu Sensei in the U.S., Duke Moore Judan, Jerry Kunzman Kudon, and Wally Jay Judan, Schraeder Hachidan, and earned the rank of Yodan. I also studied Aikido under Walter Todd for three years, Hachidan. 

I've taught - all around the world during my life while traveling on business in Europe and Asia. Often taking classes and working out with some of the most amazing martial artists of my time. The techniques Keanu executes in movies are so amazing, so perfect that I can name everyone as they're performed. Never a single technique executed in any scene that I would call sloppy. Between the long hours of practice for each scene and his trainers and choreographers, he makes actors like Steven Seagal look like a fake. I would have no problem awarding Keanu a Sandan in Jujitsu, the highest rank I can sign off on.",True

So I did what some religions do, I started ready, contacting the dead relatives, preparing for the afterlife like the Egyptians do, people in China send their dead money, it's called Joss paper, don't believe me, look it up! The Egyptians did something similar, they'd bury their dead with things they would need in the afterlife. I know if I had stayed where I was, I was going to be a slave, chained up in the darkness and at the bottom of the chain subject to all these spirits. I needed to find a way to make it AFTER I died, that's what I was truly consumed by. I sought out magicians who seemed to know something I didn't. Read books, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, etc. Until one day I was so depressed and overtaken by life I felt desperate and knew I was completely lost with no hope here or ever. That's when I heard that Jesus ALREADY died for my sins. He paid the price. When I die and I am asked what will I do will all my sins, all I have to do is say ""Jesus is my savior."" He is the key🔑 to eternal life. Get it? We are here to get tested. Don't forget the key. Don't forget what you were taught, it is real. I cannot not share the news with you. It's the most important thing in life you know how to get eternal life. It's what you were taught if you grew up Christian, it's the most important thing anyone could ever be told. We live in a first-world nation, in the year 2022 After Christ. Get it? You aren't supposed to be lost and desperate, we just chose to believe lies. And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. John 8:32",True

@hibernopithecus7500,2022-11-12T11:05:33Z,0,"The first film wasn’t great. Really good just not great when you revisit it. But it was a glass of ice cold beer in the otherwise sea of warm piss that was shaky-cam, jump-cut action films.
But the sequels have been excellent, the way they stayed true to the action sequence ethos of the first film and built an original universe on it.
And this looks like it takes that to the next level.
The John Wick films are the type of films The Expendables want to be when they grow up.",True

They created a whole parallel universe, with a deep story, not to mention an incredible sense of humour.  Where could they go from there?  The question I asked myself after every film.  But they did!  The twists, the turns - nothing predicable - a whole universe was created and deepened, always with some tongue in cheek.  This series has totally blown me away.

-John’s clearly capable and a total badass, so I’d imagine training came easier for him - did he spend any of his spare time learning ballet?

@AlfredAmeneyro21,2022-11-11T14:21:17Z,40,"John Wick is a phenomenon. It came in the midst of many other revenge movies at the time, with seasoned actors playing the main roles and many of us thought that it was just another forgettable action movie you would find in the Walmart dvd pit. But it was not. It's a beast. I got to see the 2nd one before the first one and I was blown away (the somelier scene is what got me into this world). I needed to understand what was happenning. And I'll be damned. What started as a simple project of seasoned stunt actors doing some kind of passion project, turned out to be a fleshed out idea, a story of underground assassins and the rules and world building it has is absolutle fantastic, and each sequel adds another layer of this world and each time we are more and more invested in this world:
1. Oh, you stole my car and killed my dog, prepare to die.
2. Oh, you got out of your retirement for revenge, you owe me a favour. 
3. Oh, you killed an important person in neutral ground, prepare to die. 
4. Bring it on.....

And since then, many other action movies have tried to follow on John Wick steps (at least in terms of how to do stunts) and only a few have done it right. ATOMIC BLONDE and most recently BULLET TRAIN are the better examples of the post JOHN WICK inspired action movies. And that is cheating, because they are directed by David Leitch, co creator of Wick...",True

@claytonsteele9310,2022-11-11T10:44:45Z,0,"First off let me state that I enjoy the franchise very much. However what I think is ridiculous is everyone fangirl swooning over Keanu Reeves as though he carried the movies. I disagree. The movies were well written, better than your typical action flick. The John Wick franchise is to action flicks what the Lord of The Rings trilogy is to the fantasy movie genre. It sets the standard for what the rest need to follow. John Wick is what all action flicks should be like. Great storyline, great action, and characters you find yourself drawn to. Keanu Reeves is 1/3 of a great recipe, not the whole pie. They picked the right actor to play the part, I wholeheartedly agree, but the writing was exceptionally well done and the action was both exciting and believable with Keanu taking as many hits as the enemies. Like someone else said in the comments, this movie gave us a unique look into the underworld that other action movies just glimpsed at. This was not a movie with just a great actor.....this was an awesome franchise from beginning to end!",True

That this world would intrigue people and make them interested in knowing more about it. It was so well written, so well directed. But most importantly, Keanu made this movie franchise what it is today. 
Part of what makes the John Wick series so memorable is the portrayal of the unique culture of the underworld with its hierarchy, rules, scope, etc. It completely sidesteps all the typical mafia tropes we've come to expect from Hollywood, I look forward to seeing more of that in this latest film. Oh and also watching Keanu generously distributing copious amounts of lead and death to random bad guys.",True

@rawheadrexx11,2022-11-11T03:13:30Z,0,"Goodbye to you, my trusted friend.
We've known each other since we were nine or ten.
Together we've climbed hills and trees.
Learned of love and ABC's,
skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.

Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die,
when all the birds are singing in the sky,
Now that the spring is in the air.
Pretty girls are everywhere.
Think of me and I'll be there.

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun.
But the hills that we climbed
were just seasons out of time.

Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me,
I was the black sheep of the family.
You tried to teach me right from wrong.
Too much wine and too much song,
wonder how I got along.

Goodbye, Papa, it's hard to die
when all the birds are singing in the sky,
Now that the spring is in the air.
Little children everywhere.
When you see them I'll be there.

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun.
But the wine and the song,
like the seasons, have all gone.

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun.
But the wine and the song,
like the seasons, have all gone.

Goodbye, Michelle, my little one.
You gave me love and helped me find the sun.
And every time that I was down
you would always come around
and get my feet back on the ground.

Goodbye, Michelle, it's hard to die
when all the bird are singing in the sky,
Now that the spring is in the air.
With the flowers everywhere.
I wish that we could both be there.

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun.
But the stars we could reach
were just starfish on the beach

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun.
But the stars we could reach
were just starfish on the beach

We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun,
But the wine and the song,
like the seasons, have all gone.

All our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun.
But the hills that we climbed
Were just seasons out of time....",True

@asdfasdf-iw5mi,2022-11-11T02:16:03Z,0,"WHAT IS THE GOSPEL?
The Gospel is good news: Your debt has been paid; Your penalty has been carried out. That’s what the word “Gospel” means. 

“Propitiation” in the Bible is defined as “the act of gaining or regaining the favor or goodwill of someone or something; the act of appeasement as in a sacrifice; specifically an atoning sacrifice.” 

2 Corinthians 5:21
For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. 

Jesus allowed Himself to be the appeasement to the Father for all our sins. He was not forced to do this, but did so willingly. (John 10:18) Also, He gave Himself as the pure and acceptable sacrifice, not only for God’s chosen Jewish people, but for everyone in the world for all time. (John 10:16) 

For just a brief moment of His agony, our Savior experienced what it would be like to be separated from the Father forever. This was the moment He dreaded the most of the entire crucifixion, when God would have to look away as His Son took on every sin this world would ever commit. That would’ve been the moment when Jesus exclaimed; “My God! My God! Why have You forsaken Me?” (Matthew 27:46)  

Being a perfect and righteous God, He can tolerate no sin whatsoever. There are people who believe they have never sinned, but Romans 3:23-25 and Romans 6:23 sets this straight. Romans 3:23-25; “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, (24) and are justified by His grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, (25) whom God put forward as a propitiation by His blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in His forbearance, He had passed over former sins.” This is emphasized in Psalm 103:12 that states our sins are removed “as far as east is from west”. Only the perfect sinless blood of Jesus could accomplish this. 

Going to Romans 6:23, we see just how the Father feels about sin, and just how important the sacrifice of our Savior really was; “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” 

THE GOSPEL! 

BELIEVE and RECEIVE Jesus' free gift of salvation:
📖1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 
Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the GOSPEL which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are SAVED, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ DIED for our SINS according to the scriptures; And that he was BURIED, and that he ROSE again the third day according to the scriptures:   

The only hope we have is Jesus. Jesus is the answer. He’s the only answer, and He’s the only hope. And His return for us as His church is our only hope. That’s what the good news is. 

In fact, in 1 Thessalonians, the first epistle that the Apostle Paul wrote, he shares the gospel in the context of the Rapture in Chapter 4 of 1 Thessalonians, saying, for we believe that Jesus was crucified, buried, and rose again on the third day, and He’s coming back again one day. That’s the good news. 

RELIGION SAYS DO. JESUS CHRIST SAYS DONE!! 

Soon one life will be PAST and that which only was done for Jesus Christ will LAST! 

📖Ephesians 1:13-14
13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. 

📖2 Corinthians 11:3
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 

Do You Know God Personally? God LOVES you and offers a wonderful PLAN for your life. 

God’s Love
“God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life” 

God’s Plan
[Jesus speaking] “I came that they might have life, and might have it abundantly” [that it might be full and meaningful” (John 10:10). 

Why is it that most people are not experiencing the abundant life? Because…Man is SINFUL and SEPARATED from God. Therefore, he cannot know and experience God’s love and plan for his life. 

Man Is Sinful
“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). Man was created to have fellowship with God; but, because of his stubborn self-will, he chose to go his own independent way, and fellowship with God was broken. This self-will, characterized by an attitude of active rebellion or passive indifference, is an evidence of what the Bible calls sin. 

Man Is Separated
“The wages of sin is death” [spiritual separation from God] (Romans 6:23). Man is continually trying to reach God and the abundant life through his own efforts, such as a good life, philosophy, or religion – but he inevitably fails. The only way to bridge this gulf… 

He Died in Our Place
“God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8).  

He Rose From the Dead
“Christ died for our sins…He was buried…He was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures…He appeared to Peter, then to the twelve. After that He appeared to more than five hundred…” (1 Corinthians 15:3-6).  

He Is the Only Way to God
“Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me’” (John 14:6). 

This shows that God has bridged the gulf which separates us from Him by sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross in our place to pay the penalty for our sins. It is not enough just to know this…We must individually RECEIVE Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then we can know and experience God’s love and plan for our lives. 

We Must Receive Christ
“As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name” (John 1:12)  

We Receive Christ Through Faith
“By grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast” (Ephesians 2:8,9).When We Receive Christ, We Experience a New Birth ( John 3:1-8). 

We Receive Christ by Personal Invitation
[Christ speaking] “Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any one hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him” (Revelation 3:20). Receiving Christ involves turning to God from self (repentance) and trusting Christ to come into our lives to forgive our sins and to make us what He wants us to be. Just to agree intellectually that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for our sins is not enough. Nor is it enough to have an emotional experience. We receive Jesus Christ by faith, as an act of the will. All the work of salvation was done by Jesus Himself. He took upon Himself the punishment for our sins as well as the sins themselves, and went to the cross and paid for every sin that would ever be committed throughout history. 

WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE BORN AGAIN?... 

The phrase “born again” applies to people who have accepted Jesus as their Savior or Redeemer. The born again soul realizes that they are a sinner (Romans 3:23) and that the penalty for that sin is death (Romans 6:23). To rectify the circumstances, God sent His only Son to die in their place, to take the punishment for sin (Romans 5:8). After Jesus’ death, He arose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:3-6). Jesus is the only way to God (John 14:6) and He provides the blessing of salvation. Each person has the choice to receive or reject God’s gift through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9) and experience new birth (John 3:1-8).  

WHAT IS BIBLICAL REPENTANCE?
Biblical repentance is God centered repentance comes from the greek word 'METANOIA' which means change of one's mind and heart which imparts a new direction to the whole life.
Repent (To repent, in relation to salvation, is to change your mind from unbelief to belief in Jesus Christ. To being dead in your sins to a new creature in Christ) and believe in the Gospel. 

The ABCs of Salvation: 

The A is for: Admit or acknowledge that you’ve sinned, that you need the Savior. Romans 3:10 says, “There is no one righteous, not even one.” Romans 3:23 tells us why. It’s because “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Romans 6:23 says, “The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” 

The B very simply is for: Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord. Romans 10:9-10 says, “If you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you will be saved.” 

The C stands for: Call upon the name of the Lord. Or as Romans 10:9-10 also says, “If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” Here’s why, “For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” Romans 10:13 tells us how. It says, “All who call upon the name of the Lord will be saved.”

His sacrifice was sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2). A created being could not pay the infinite penalty required for sin against an infinite God. Only God could pay such an infinite penalty. Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death and that true and only God is JESUS! And He did all that because He wants to save our souls and have a relationship with us. Jesus is waiting for you to come to Him, He's the only way to Heaven, only He can save us from sin and from hell ( John 14, Romans 6:23, Luke 13:3). He won't cast you away from Himself if you come to Him. He calls us all to repentance, He wants to save us. believe and have faith in God then the Holy Spirit will come in and lead you to repent of your sins and God will forgive you of your sins and cleanse you by the blood of Jesus and you'll get born again by His Holy Spirit

And on top of that in the 3rd one the fight scenes were telegraphed to much and at points overly contrived...like they are running around and fighting and somehow they end up in a knife and hatchet store or museum or something...?!....what are the odds?

it just wasn't that good...except Mark Ducascos...he was fun.

And the preview here with the stairs fight scene...it just looked odd like he is out in the open turning his back...like the henchmen gots to have like Stormtrooper levels of inacuracy to miss.  Then the fight teased with Donnie Yen...5 feet apart and missing?

and they make the whole organization BIGGER!  AND add in some sort of civil war!  and a duel! what made the first so good was the minimalist nature...like this is getting silly.",True

@MrMozkoZrout,2022-11-10T22:03:18Z,0,"I mean i loved the first one, it was a simple action story. The second one was bigger in all directions, maybe even better, it explored John's tragic backstory. The third one however was a bit too long and kinda focused on other things than John's character a his reason to fight a bit too much. It was too long and some of the action didn't look as realistic as it used to, especially towards the end. It was also obvious that they are running out of ideas, those dogs gor boring fast and all that. And i am affraid this one will be a similar story, a lot of insane action that went a bit too far from the plausible style of the original. Like they are shooting at each other from two meters while holding a sword and nobody hits anything ?",True

The people who do this for real are quite often completely deplorable and have no redeeming qualities at all. But for entertainment, it's great. Those things that were stolen while you were staying at a top hotel, those kind of people inhabit this world, and are not any where near as noble as John. But the people they work for are even worse, and u won't know who they are, ever.Dont get some romantic notion that the movies are how it truly is because if you read the news in any country on any day you will find that it is only the people at the top who keep it all, and the rest of us scrounge for their table scraps. I don't have anything against them other than romanticising something that impressionable minds might believe is a good way to make a living and life.

The intricacies in the stories are in the details of the world. The rules of the hotel. Whatt motivates these individuals to break/ follow those rules?

like what even is happening in these movies 3 and 4, when did john wick become Underworld/Matrix/Bleach in the worse way possible. like come on, nunchucks, blind swordsman katana fights, is that lady using a bow. were these movies written by middle schooler, I seriously can't tell. twirling a revolver. seriously.",True

I read that Scott Adkins is going to be in this in some way, shape, or form, so hoping that he gets a decent role, and not just a quick scene or two and that's it.  With Scott's skills, talent, and acting ability, he deserves to get a good role in this.  Didn't see him in the trailer so just a little concerned.

Also, I am hoping that John Wick's Mustang makes a glorious and bad ass return at some point as well!  But can't wait either way, these films have all been friggin excellent!",True
