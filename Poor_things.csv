@hallernorbi,2024-04-14T10:29:20Z,0,"SPOILER: I've been thinking about how the ending could have been more impactful. We could have had flashbacks of the real husband's cruelty while Bella reads a diary or experiences nightmares, slowly realizing that her mother committed suicide because of him. This way, at the end of the movie, they wouldn't have had to introduce a new storyline to build up this character. So by the time the husband shows up in the church and interrupts the wedding, we viewers already know that another conflict is brewing. Just showing Emma Stone's angry face would have been enough... as she transforms into vengeful, relishing in the moment, as the time for revenge has come. Then a cut, and we see the operating room where Bella drags in a goat. And another cut, and they live happily ever after while the ex-husband grazes. This way, the ending would have been tighter and funnier.",True

@StellaAdler_,2024-04-10T23:57:55Z,3,"A movie for paedos!! HOW are people NOT seeing it??? 

We must work. We must make money. But more than that, we must experience everything. Not just the good, but degradation, horror, and sadness. This makes us whole, Bella. It makes us people of substance, not flighty, untouched children. When we know the world, the world is ours. Now, go and f*ck someone.”

This quote sums up the movie’s core message, and there is much to unpack.

First, what’s wrong with “untouched children”? They’re supposed to be untouched. This movie DOES NOT like children.

Second, this quote reflects the dualistic worldview of the occult elite, where it is believed that the bad, the evil, and the horrific are of equal value as the pure, the good, and the godly. It is by uniting the two that a person becomes “illuminated.”

Finally, the madame probably doesn’t even believe in what she’s saying. She wants Bella to do degrading things so she can profit from her – the same way the elite wants us to believe in their indoctrination so they can profit from us.

The movie makes sure we see Bella being degraded in every way possible. Also, simultaneously, the viewers are watching actress Emma Stone being degraded as well. The movie’s insistence on depicting sex scenes involving the actress takes on a ritualistic dimension where she’s being initiated through humiliation.


One of her clients is an older, rather gross butcher who smells awful. After the encounter, Bella says that the sex was “brutal in a strangely not unpleasant way.”


Bella (and Emma Stone) gets humped on by this guy while the audience is treated with full frontal nudity. Apparently, that’s what you need to do to win an Oscar nowadays.


In another scene, a father has sex with Bella in front of his children for “education.” While doing it, Bella gives sex advice to the boys who sit there and watch. More sexualization of children.


Also, Bella discovers that she’s bisexual. Of course.

Bella’s girlfriend is a socialist. She tells Bella that a socialist is “someone who wants to change the world for the better.” To which Bella instantly replies:

“Then I am that too.”

The movie’s unabashed promotion of a specific political current is odd but unsurprising. Poor Things is not mere entertainment; it is creative indoctrination. In case you didn’t notice, the elite has been hard at work trying to create a socialist world government. They want us to associate the word socialist with “changing the world for the better.” If the movie had promoted any other political current, the movie would have been shunned.

So, Bella reflects what the elite want women to be. However, her actions cause Duncan to lose his mind completely.


Duncan ends up in the looney bin.

While Bella is the creation of a man dubbed God, Duncan sees in her the exact opposite:

“He has sent a demon at a large into the world. The devil wrapped in an alluring body that cannot be satieted and a mind that picks people apart stitch by stitch like a bloodied and burned rag doll shat out of an elephant’s arse.”

While the “demon” is at large, her creator is dying.

God is Dead
When Bella learns that God is dying of cancer, she leaves Paris and travels back to London. The fact that God dies in the movie is symbolic as, in the elite’s philosophy, men are gods.

In London, Bella reconnects with Max, with whom she was engaged before she left.


Bella asks Max if “the whoring thing challenges the desire for ownership that men have.”

Again, her being a prostitute is framed as some feminist power move that goes against the desire of men to own women. Max says he’s okay with it because it’s “her body.”


Although they get married in a church, the black-and-white pattern inside of it indicates that this is actually about the occult elite’s dualistic “religion.”

After God’s death, Bella takes over as the mad scientist. In the final scene, everything ends perfectly according to the elite’s vision for humanity.


Bella lives with her socialist lesbian lover.


Bella placed the brain of a goat into the head of her mother’s controlling husband. This man is technically Bella’s father. But not anymore. He’s a goat now.


The movie ends with a shot of Bella reading. She is now an accomplished socialist bisexual lady. Every man who tried to control her is either dead or completely broken. Or a goat.

The end.

In Conclusion
There’s a reason why mass media tastemakers celebrate Poor Things: It reflects the culture and mindset the elite is looking to force on the masses. It is representative of a society that is steadily straying away from everything pure and natural to embrace the sick, the twisted, and, yes, the ungodly. From God’s distorted face to the hybrid animal monstrosities running around to Bella awkwardly walking with an infant’s brain – everything we see is in complete opposition to the natural order of things.

But that distortion is not merely esthetic. The movie also obsesses over twisted concepts such as the sexualization of children and female “empowerment” through sexual degradation. In this movie, a child discovering the world does not play around in nature; it plays with a dead man’s penis while stabbing him in the eyes. Of course, not all movies need to portray happy, pretty things. But Poor Things’ core message is that these disturbing things are good and desirable in an enlightened society.",True

@davidkoblentz,2024-04-06T05:29:49Z,0,"Can I ask you commenters a question... (loved the movie) I sort of wanted Bella to kill herself after meeting her 'husband' (realizing how she came to be sort of) and find her washed up on the shore with a fish hook in her nose (kind of total full circle).  Did anyone else think this would end darkly? I totally get the real ending as it is also circular as she winds up a surgeon much like Godwin, in fact she is surpassing him as her first surgery is not on animals but on her piece of garbage husband...  just curious of your thoughts.  What a great flick and I am glad that Yorgos did not make all the actors talk the same way as the other previous movies (except Bella perhaps) even though they were saying totally bonkers things.",True

@nyChannel09,2024-04-03T00:01:41Z,1,"Compared to mullholland drive, this movie is like the worst SNL episode you have ever seen.
Not even the ending is well done (for example).


SPOILER:




A human with a goat brain eating the same stuff as a goat would to survive (grass and water)...
The human food needs didnt go away, only its brain changed (lets of course say it does work...).
The nutrients the human will need to survive stay the same, they wont change, just because they changed the brain.

Movie is supposed to take place in the 1880s...
-->The first lobotomy was performed in the late 1880s, when Swiss physician Gottlieb Burckhardt removed parts of the brain cortex in patients suffering from auditory hallucinations and other symptoms of schizophrenia.

Even if you try to watch the story through a young childs eyes, doesnt make sense.
I dont get it, why not make it realistic?

Lets take the whole premiss of the original story, why not actually make it realistic so you can actually feel her being the age/mental age she´s supposed to be in that moment?",True

@AImaniaX,2024-04-02T07:38:22Z,20,"Here's my review, 

So this movie makes me feel all sorts of emotions. It's like something I've never really seen, can't really put it even in a category. So without giving the movie away I'm gonna tell you what I took from this movie. 

First, its about if someone had a fresh start how they would take on a different path. 

Second it shows just how much men influence women by trying to manipulate, control and confine them. Treating a woman as property instead of a human being. You will not see all demonized in this, instead you will be able to recognize the good men from the bad ones. It shows both sides. 

Thirdly it challenged even my own thinking and it made me realize how I have let men influence me. I do think for myself but I also believe I'm too nice. 😊 But this Bella Baxtor lady I love...... Her character. Emma Stone did exceptional in this 

I guess the only negative I would say on it is there is no consequences for Bellas actions. She thinks on impulse alot and even when educating herself she chooses a path that is a little shocking. However in the end she seems to be able to redeem herself in alot of ways 

The one thing I love so much is she never is sorry, she might be impulsive even cold hearted but she lets herself become open to new experiences. All without letting these things negatively affect her. 

It's like she deflects alot she doesn't allow other people to define HER. Iove this. It's how I think I refuse to let others get the best of me. But even I can be negatively effected. But seeing this character I think gosh I love to be like this like so unapologetic and adventurious. It shows the double standard of how men are freely to do what they wish but when a woman does it everyone judges her, it shows how ridiculous that is and let's it land right on its head. It's a wacky movie but a good one I would watch again because it's also heartfelt.",True

It just leaves you with a convoluted mess of feelings that you don't even know what is coursing through your veins. It's a grotesque work, sure to give you nightmares. Sure, the cinematography is interesting, if you can get past the first half hour of absolutely weird introduction. And the theme of discovering the world and giving it your own meaning, not being enclosed by societal standards is something nice to think about. But, the child/mentally reduced molestation and abuse is a terrible implication which will never sit well no matter how you spin it. This was just the rotting cherry on top.",True

West is now so developed that they now don't understand between free, independent women and  being  uncultured whore is two different thing. No women must accept this movie as normal..literally it is soft porn..shown in big cinema...... Modern Women doesn't need to be shown 
less respectful or lust full...this is not how  a human likes to be treated in reality. 
HOLLYWOOD just exploits the power of Media. This is somewhat a pedophiles dream come true movie...and showing this to normal people is more weird ...then Wester people Say they have too many psychopath in their country.

If the movie had a true aim or intent to show kids true mindset when she is  surrounded by so many dirty and negative minded people ...it would have shown the kid running away from all this when it is smart...not go into those activities and enjoy.  This has all the lusty thoughts of the writer ,director , producer ...who had the power to show something positive...but evidently money and power in the wrong hands can corrupt the masses and this movie is the example..people praising this movie are so dumb to accept it",True

No echoes of conformity mar her stride,
She dances freely, unburdened by pride,
Through fields of feeling, she roams unbound,
In a kaleidoscope of colors, she's found.

Others, shaped by society's decree,
Bear the marks of its scrutiny, they see,
But Bella, a rebel of the heart's call,
Defies the norm, embracing the all.

In her, the essence of pure delight,
Unveiling the world in its rawest light,
For she's a canvas untouched by judgment's hand,
A masterpiece of freedom, forever grand.",True

I see Emma won best actress at the Oscars which isn’t a surprise considering how talented she is, but does anyone have anything positive to say about this film? The trailer looks awful yet the cast is great. It reminds me of when I said this about the “Grand Budapest Hotel” nearly 10 years ago lol how it had such an amazing cast but looked stupid. I ended up watching the movie after seeing the awards and quickly had a change of heart. It was very good. Maybe Poor Things is one of those movies that looks dumb despite a fantastic cast, but is actually good. We shall see lol",True
@Raphael-2,2024-03-12T15:29:01Z,0,"At first I didn't want to watch this after reading disgusted comments and as someone who already has to endure disturbing dreams in the same style. But after also seeing people who loved the movie I thought I should try for myself.
Well now I know who is the director of my dreams because I swear this movie seems like out of my own dreams. I actually wanted to watch this because I was curious how it would feel like to be able to see a ""dream"" on a screen. I was not disappointed in this aspect, the movie style, story and scenery procured the most otherworldly, occult atmosphere that I had only experienced in my dreams until now (maybe beside The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus).
I really enjoyed that aspect I must say, the decors, the filming, the story-telling. It was extraordinary.
But then, probably a quarter of the movie was rather explicit sex scenes and it was hard to watch, not to mention the butchery imagery that forced me to look away and close the sound multiple times.
I have to say the pedo sex did not occupy my mind that much as it was probably one of the less unnatural things happening in the movie, and the character had almost nothing of a child's mind for most of it. I'm not sure you can even compare it.
Anyways, it was amazing, it was disturbing also. I do not regret watching but I won't tell a soul about it.",True

@MaxwellGriffin001,2024-03-11T20:58:15Z,3,"My review after seeing this recently...contrived. It tries too hard. The director falls into the same trap that Zack Snyder does where they go for the frame without building to it. The difference is Snyder lifts directly from the source material whereas Yorgos sources different material.

It's exploitative of the sexual encounters. There's no art in that, it's just soft-core porn.

Last point, it has a pre-requisites in the acting style. If you're not familiar with dry, melancholy, apathetic delivery of the punchlines, or never seen a well delivered Oscar Wilde play...you'll be put off, because this movie doesn't lure you into the style with charm as a Wes Anderson movie might, instead it chugs along with or without you. It's hard to tell if the actors are good or bored which is probably why so many actors do it...because it doesn't take much effort for a good actor and bad actors can come across as ""stylized"" rather than poor.

It's too dense to watch passively, and not entertaining enough to commit an evening to. There's a small sliver of an audience that this works for: the lonely (horny) insomniac, wasting away waiting tables, crushed by the debt of an art degree they'll never use, doing everything possible to be ""different""/""artsy"" and not understanding why they don't get the same results in life as the people they want to be different than.

6/10 Production crew seemed stellar. Editing was average.",True

Yeah, of course beginning is interesting, but finding out in middle that she got her kid's brain put inside of her disturbed me, like it's disgusting, poor kid. Then that girl who might as well be 20 is in child's mind and enjoying doing gross stuff and men are taking advantage of it? It feels weird and disturbing. Should have ended differently. But speaking in cinematography it was great, how at start it's black and white and then later on it changes to colorful, because she's happy and then we see world like she sees it.

This is what makes people wanna go to the cinema. Its movies like this one, that make people wonder,  make them think and feel, longing for more. This should have the hype that 'Barbenheimer' had. Also, Emma Stone is a revelation, sucking you in with her astonishing performance in such a complex, fun, yet surely difficult to execute acting role..

@javierabcde9880,2024-01-30T08:09:15Z,0,"Pues, en efecto, y tal como había leído y oído por ahí, excelente film del maestro Lanthimos, cineasta polémico y en no pocos momentos muy criticado por su particular y muy peculiar universo, pero todo un Maestro, así con mayúsculas.
Un film muy rico visualmente, muy creativo a todos los niveles, un manjar plásticamente gracias a una memorable puesta en escena, con fotogramas bellísimos y magnificados por la bellísima fotografía, tanto en blanco y negro como en color, y por la banda sonora, de gran potencia.
Aspectos técnicos como vestuario y peluquería, así como dirección artística, son encomiables, logrando que, quizás la mayoría de las veces, pareciera que estamos contemplando un cuadro y viendo y oyendo un cuento, con gran poesía interna, pero no exento de crueldad y dolor.
Soberbias interpretaciones, sobre todo del dúo Emma Stone y Mark Ruffalo, este en un papel dificilísimo, mostrando a veces en la misma escena la perplejidad del personaje, junto a su alegría, picardía, dolor, soledad, según sea su estado anímico provocado por la compañía de la protagonista, a la que, evidentemente, había juzgado mal al conocerla.
De larga duración, ni te enteras pues no tiene desperdicio.
Un canto al empoderamiento, a la resiliencia, al feminismo reivindicativo, que contra viento y marea lucha por florecer y conservar la dignidad y el respeto, procurando en todo momento ser libre de cuerpo y pensamiento.
En mi opinión, magnífico trabajo de Lanthimos, creo yo que, por descontado, su obra más redonda, que no deja indiferente a nadie, ofreciéndole también a la vez que un profundo drama humano, notables momentos de humor, sobre todo con el atribulado personaje excelentemente interpretado por Mark Ruffalo.
Recomendable cien por cien.

@nerd26373,2024-01-19T09:01:28Z,0,"Seems like Emma Stone is eager to take on more seductive and more provocative roles on screen. Her portrayal of Victoria Blessington/Bella serves as a testament to women who were and still continue to be oppressed and mistreated. Personally I don't necessarily think that those graphic sex scenes are unnecessary to put in this film. As Emma Stone puts it, 'It is essential for Bella's growth and maturity' and that 'women deserve to crave something that even the walls of society won't grant them to do.' Poor Things might be Yorgos Lanthimos's most bizarre and most explicit films to date. It'll definitely take you in for a major shock.

It is a no holds barred view of life from the eyes of an innocent, which details the awfulness but also the most joyful aspects of it.

I had to explain some of  the film to Zihan but I was surprised at how close he came to understanding most of it.  There was a lot of history of cinema, history of art, Feminist philosophy and Existential philosophy in it.  Zihan even nailed the artwork as ""Gothic/art nouveau/steampunk"".  The film also had  an embarrassing amount of sex in it, but that was absolutely necessary for the story. Emma Stone went through all the stages of human development - babyhood (opening scene with Emma Stone acting infantile because she had just been created), happy childhood with an indulgent ""father"" who allowed her to explore in safety, teenage rebellion, twenties - ""I want to learn and try everything in the world and danger and pain be damned"" to maturity - a truly self-created person..

@LittleDarkLies,2023-12-25T03:38:55Z,13,"Spoilers - the plot and message the film was trying to explore was wonderful but.....on the other hand, it also felt like the film didn't hit that Wes Anderson 2 hour mark so in order to be up there as a longer film they just kept adding in any extra sex scenes along with looooooonnnng walks where nothing really happens.
Interesting characters disappear as fast as they're introduced, and often, the film feels like it is trying to force emotions through its music without setting up much to earn it
Truly felt like I didn't waste nor enjoy my time seeing the film

@edvardzv5660,2023-08-15T18:11:01Z,0,"Reading the books of the New Testament, we probably asked ourselves more than once: *""Why 2000 years we do not see those miracles that accompanied the Сhurch of Christ in the I century, as described in the New Testament?""* Why do the so-called preachers of Christ have to prove that Jesus really existed and atheists boldly deny the historicity or divine origin of Christ? Maybe because the Сhurch of Christ has not existed for 2000 years?
The Сhurch does not exist in the form in which it is presented in the books of the New Testament, but there are Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant and other christian sects claiming to be the place of the Church, but they not have the only thing that distinguishes the divine from the human and is characteristic of just the Сhurch of Christ -the reinforcement of the word with signs, that is, miracles (Mark 16:15-20). Therefore, some researchers doubt the historicity of Christ, and some of them are not opposed to declaring him a an ordinary philosopher, teacher. But even if Jesus were an ordinary philosopher, his disciples would be ordinary followers of Jesus. And they would not dare to write about the miracles that not only Jesus, but also his disciples, could perform. If there were the Church in our time as described by the authors of the New Testament books, where miracles are performed, the sick are healed, where prophesied, and the dead are raised, no one would doubt the historicity of Christ. Then there would be the same controversy throughout the world as in the first century - Jesus the Son of God or the false prophet who seduces the world by miracles. As a result, we can say that the emergence and development of christian sects and atheism was the result of the fact that over the 2000 years the Сhurch of Christ did not exist.

Find *""The Mystery about the Church of Christ""* video on YouTube. The video reveals the prophecy of the disappearance and reappearance of the Church of Christ before the End of the World. Watching this video will give hope to all who sincerely seek God and will interest those who are not too lazy to think freely.

@AgapeYeshua,2023-06-09T15:18:20Z,1,"The Gospel:


1 Corinthians 15:3-4:
3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4 that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,

John 3:16-18:
16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.

18 “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

1 Peter 2:24:
“He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.”

(Hi! Much love to you and everybody, and I thank you if you give this message a read! Also my friend put together an amazing PowerPoint about Jesus being the prophesied Messiah! If you'd like to see it just ask and I'll reply with the link :)
I pray for your peace and for great days ahead of you, and that you find that Jesus(Yeshua) is the Only Truth~)
