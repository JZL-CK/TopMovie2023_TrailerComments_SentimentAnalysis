1. When the grand uncle world was destroyed (tower collapsed) does that mean the pelicans are now free? since they were stuck on the island starving and thus lead them to eat the wara wara and they weren’t native to the magic world ? Does that mean they returned to their real world 

2. himi burns and kills some wara wara trying to protect the majority of them and some wara wara get eaten doesnt that mean the dead wara wara also reincarnate again? since the wara wara are a reference to how souls are created and the the movie theme is about life and death and reincarnation? 
and kiriko says that himi killing some of them with her fire will help the majority to be reborn doesnt that also imply that these souls also regulate anyways even if they get burned or die?",True

i was wondering why did the step-mother shouted at mahito and said that she hated him when she was in the labour room? what was her reason to say that to him? she seems quiet attentive to mahito when they're in the real world, i thought even if she struggled to make amends with mahito, she wouldn't respond to him that way.

@user-ejit353fere,2024-04-15T18:21:00Z,1,"One great thing being Japanese is to get to see his film in the original language and being able to immerse yourself to it.

Hayao spoke to audience through every character in this film. Everybody represents some part of Hayao Miyazaki.

If you stop trying to follow the story you start to see it as a cluster of bare sketches and unfinished idea lined up randomly.
Those are the primal visions to be another Hayao Miyazaki film but he knew his time won’t be enough for every single ideas he has.

And I guess he tried to showcase them in a form of “art film” and that’s what this film is I think. This is built differently from all his works.

They’re keep pushing limit of 2D animation that’s just AMAZING.",True

@kaisa6849,2024-03-15T20:22:39Z,2,"This is the biggest fail in Miyazaki’s career in my opinion, i just watched it. There is no story, it’s bits and pieces of random shit sewn together, i feel like the art, music, are the authentic Ghibli but that hardly what makes movies, i feel nothing for the main character let alone the other characters, he isn’t expressing nothing, he isn’t talking, his voice actor sounds too mature for him. By hour 1 still no development, everything was rushed, not enough context, the heron was a meh character, his mom/himi too. Wtf was this about Miyazaki, it’s like i was given a box of empty boxes which took me 2 hours to unrap and find f-all. This one killed any potential intrest i might have for futur Ghibli movies, let the man retire.
Edit :
For some reason i think the tower king/great uncle is Miyazaki, and this is his interpretation of him trying to pass the torch irl (handing over his company to his kin) and failing. I think the blocks bit at the end is him coming up with stories and him hitting the end of his creative well, if i am right on this this would explain all the bullshit, and i take it.",True

After watching the Golden Globe Awards, British Academy Awards, and award trends in the past few months, and watching the several-minute video message from producer Suzuki and director Hayao Miyazaki that appeared on the Oscar website a few days ago, I was actually convinced that he would win the Academy Award.

 I sincerely  appreciate 7-years' all the efforts that 83-year-old Mr.Miyazaki did.　😘


I assume that he will not appear in the mass media or leave any special comments about the award, as he's very shy and not interested in the worldly award race any more.
But I have no doubt that he is very happy in his heart, because this has become a big step in connecting to the next generation of Studio Ghibli. He has realized “pass the stone” to the next young generation!!

II'm very proud that he won the award as one of Japanese.
And I feel soooo happy about this!😘

I was surprised to see Christian Bale on the end credits and some familiar names but i couldn't discern their voices because either the volume in the cinema was not loud enough or just my ears. And am so glad to see Bale and Hamill bringing characters to life with their voices again.

What really surprised me was the voice of the Heron, Pattinson really caught us off guard. 

My wish is that we get to see another masterpiece from one of the greatest film maker Hayao Miyazaki. Wishing him great health in body spirit and soul so that he can still bring more of his magic to generations of audience young and old.",True

It takes ONE HOUR + to do anything magical or anythign at all (seriously you just get slice of life and drawn out scenes) ... 
then you are not sure if the boy has a fever for 20minutes... and then the movie 'suddenly remembers' its magical and throws 1 (or severl?!) worlds at you with nonsensical and disconnected rules that somehow are important. At this point you are SUPPOSED to feel with the 'protagonist'? but he hardly talked to anyone so there is that. no idea what the idea was what the goal was.... but it shows that Miyazaki is simply very old. There is nothing coherent or fantastical or other kind of commentary. You get a few lose elements from other movies but thats about it. Nothing thats a complete meal but snipits swimming in a pot of luke warm water. Its a shame. really. i went to cinema and those 2hrs are gone :/",True

It’s incredibly imaginative, the art and the musical score by Joe Hisaishi are profoundly beautiful as always. This could really be the best Ghibli film I’ve ever seen, which means it’s the best animated film I’ve ever seen.

There’s always that lingering feeling for a few days when you really fall in love with a movie, but I think this is one I will go to again and again for a big uplifting feeling. It’s one of those movies you see and it just makes you feel better about life, you know?

After viewing the documentary, I felt that the theme of the movie is a requiem for Miyazaki's close friend, the renowned anime film director Isao Takahata, known for ""Grave of the Fireflies."" Takahata, who was Miyazaki's senior by five years, taught many things to a young Miyazaki. For Miyazaki, Takahata was a mentor, a parent, and a rival. Takahata passed away in 2018, and Miyazaki struggled to accept his death for a long time. The boy depicted in ""The Boy and the heron"" represents Miyazaki, and the great uncle is Takahata. The farewell to the great uncle is the central theme of the film, portraying Miyazaki finally breaking free from the spell of Takahata and depicting his own liberation.",True

@Miku-kf7hg,2023-12-20T00:43:09Z,1197,"I'm a Japanese woman in my 40s living in Spain, and I just saw this movie last weekend. It was the first time that I could not stop crying after watching a movie, not just Ghibli movies, but all movies. It was a movie that deeply moved my heart. This is a masterpiece created by Hayao Miyazaki, who is 82 years old and is the same age as my father, with all his soul.
 It contains a message for humanity. As you can see from the Japanese title, ""How do you guys live?"", Hayao Miyazaki is asking, ""This is how I lived my life. How do you guys live your lives?"" 

A number of prominent Japanese animation studios collaborated in the production of this work. It's a kind of repayment that shows respect and awe for what the 82-year-old Hayao Miyazaki has given us. 
I don't know why I burst into tears after watching the movie, but I feel like it was out of respect for him and gratitude, saying, ""Thank you for showing me so many great movies since my childhood.""

Unfortunately, this movie did not do well at the box office in Japan. It's a shame that people in Japan seem to be asking too much for ``correct answers'' from movies. For me, the correct interpretation is that this movie is ""art."" What is important is what the viewer feels.

I'm really happy that it's been highly rated overseas. The Academy Awards will be announced in January. The Academy Awards have fallen into commercialism, but could you please move those excectives of Hallywood who respect Hayao Miyazaki to action? 

The last Academy Award for Hayao Miyazaki!!!!
------------------------------------------------
11/03/2024 
About 30 minutes ago, the winner of the 2024 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film was announced! Congratulations to Hayao Miyazaki!
After watching the Golden Globe Awards, British Academy Awards, and award trends in the past few months, and watching the several-minute video message from producer Suzuki and director Hayao Miyazaki that appeared on the Oscar website a few days ago, I was actually convinced that he would win the Academy Award. I sincerely respect and appreciate the efforts of 83-year-old my　grandfather! I'm really happy! !",True

@Moon-lighter,2023-12-19T03:58:37Z,131,"I've rewatched this movie three times now in both subbed and dub. I really wanted to click with it on my first watch, but left the theater like a lot of people here, feeling a mixture of a bit of boredom, confusion, lost, disappointment, and ambiguity. It was kind of hard for me to accept tbh. But, like The Wind Rises, I was lost while watching, but started to really appreciate it more as I pondered and solved certain aspects of the film. I gave it two more watches with other family members, and each time, I caught on to more of the symbolism, and probably most importantly, I had a new perspective on the pacing and plot. By the third watch, I was able to just sit back and enjoy every moment, and it's now competing for my favorite Ghibli film. It's Miyazaki's most introspective film by far, and combines the mature and mellow tones of something like The Wind Rises with the childhood adventure of his earliest works.

I think the biggest killer of this movie for many fans will be expectations, followed by familiarity with Miyazaki. Based on the English trailer and name I saw, I was expecting a fast and simple adventure. It's not that. This film is slow paced, meticulous, and leaves a lot unexplained. The first half of the movie is essentiall all build up. We've also all gotten used to movies explaining each and every little thing to us and following a formulaic plot format that we all know. Miyazaki doesn't do that here at all. Characters don't explain their actions to anyone. He gives you clues to most of the puzzles but leaves it unsolved for the audience. Also, there is no static quest or objective for most of the movie. Just like life, Mahito's position and goal are always moving. Some might also feel like the transitions are rushed, but they are best described as fluid. Scenes move from one to another in a way not typical of most films. Lastly, the more familiar you are with where Miyazaki is as a creator, the more you can understand the themes. This movie is a farewell letter to his family, friends, coworkers, and fans more than anything else as he prepares us to watch his work disappear when he dies.

There are also some cultural stuff not explained. For instance, it is taboo for men to enter a woman's birthing room, especially in 1940s Japanese culture.",True

I think the ending is about him. The 16 shapes stacked up represents all his movie that he has made including this one.

I think thats how Hayao Miyazaki wants to show us that this is the end of his “universe” or his movie",True

I love the charm of the chaos that comes with studio ghibli movies but I guess I’m a little boring in the way I like a good storyline as well! To me the film felt very Hayao Miyazaki, probably the film that showcases his personality the best of all. It was dark & random & creative & the story didn’t change just because some people wouldn’t get it. He left it as is & stuck with his vision even though some people wouldn’t like it, which I think is beautiful & truly shows the abstractness of his art. I guess that’s why I can’t hate on it even though I prefer a well structured storyline, because it was unapologetically itself, and seemed to be done exactly as intended.",True

I got to see Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind at that theatre. I fell in love with his films from that point on.

And I'm not talking about cute feel good movies like From up on Poppy Hill or Ponyo, or cottagecore dreams like Arrietty and Kiki's Delivery Service. I'm talking about the good gory stuff that everyone loves like Nausicaa, Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. Because those flms are way closer in feel to the new movie than any of the previously listed ones, and anyone who thinks otherwise can suck it because they're objectively wrong. The movie feels like a blend of all studio Ghibli films combined and really hits that nostalgia factor if you pay close enough attention.

In God’s eyes, we’re special & irreplaceable. But even in his love, we, humanity rebelled against God by committing sins & he hates sins. Despite our rebellion, God still loves us & cares for us. Instead of humanity, facing their own punishment (perishing in hell) because of their rebellion towards God, Jesus (God’s only Son) was willing to took that punishment upon himself by dying on the cross for our sins so that we may be forgiven & be reunited with our Father, in heaven. God wants to have a relationship with you like Father/Child. He wants you to be saved by surrendering your life to him and repent from your sins. God is waiting on your decision but time is limited. Jesus is returning soon on earth and those who are not saved will perish in hell because they reject Jesus’s sacrifice. That’s why the gospel is preach in order to save everyone’s eternity.

And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

You only get one of those moments with great films like this. Like I still remember the 1st time I watched Pulp Fiction in 1994 (Behind my parents back when I was 13) and it completely changed my perception about cinema forever. I no longer just wanted to watch Comedies and action flicks, after Pulp I had an addiction for the art. Next film I watched in 94 after PF was Trainspotting and my taste in film was changed forever. I was now on the hunt for the greatest dramas out there, a hunt thats never ended, a hunt thats now guided me to the brilliant works of Studio Ghibli.",True
@edenalexandriab9120,2023-11-15T19:45:58Z,0,"Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love. 

Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says ""the soul that sins shall die"" - if we break one in thought/word/deed it's as if we're guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans 

. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God's perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn't and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. 

If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us into His image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. We cannot purify ourselves, but Christ lived that perfect sinless, pure life and then allotted it to our ""account"". 

That's where our righteousness comes from. Not from any good, works that you or I could do. 
It is not based on the amount of good works we do. God starts the changes, He carries it on, and He completes it in those who let Him.

It's about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him, again, through His power and instruction). 

He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if YOU had never sinned if you accept Christ's death as our own in our place. 

He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, forgiveness, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. 

He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can't. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. 

NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER

@channingbloom7125,2023-11-08T03:52:01Z,1446,"I have to remind myself of how grateful I am to see hayao miazaki films in theaters. He truly is of the last masters of his form. I will never gain the experience nor the understanding of why his films just have this sort of “magic” factor to them, but I am 100% certain that it’s there. That there is a sort of magic in his films that I can feel. Thank god that I got to live in the same time as the great hayao miazaki. It has a been a true honor to not have watched his films but to have experienced them. Can’t wait to see this movie in theaters. To see it anywhere but on the biggest screen possible would be (to myself) a sin to the love of movies. People sometimes ask about certain pieces of art and say something along the lines of “they don’t make like they use too” or something along those lines, but I want you to know that this movie is one of those movies. There will never be a movie like the boy and the heron. It truly is the last movie of a bygone era of animated movies where animation had this much care and attention to the world itself. You will find movies that will imitate and maybe be inspired by its style but never find another that is THIS AUTHENTIC to its source. If I haven’t made it clear enough, I really do urge people to see this movie. 

Edit:
Just saw the movie and I can confidently say that hayao miazaki still that greatness and that magic that’s in all of his movies. It was definitely his most personal and his most complex movie to date. It’s one of those movies that’s not easily digestible and may take 2 or more viewings to truly gain an understanding of what you saw. I’m going to see it again and try to see if I can get a better understanding of it entire. Also in every studio ghibli movie there is always that one moment where I’m watching it and i just look upon in wonder and awe and say “wow”. This movie has those moments. Can’t remember the last time I said those words in a theater before. I know it kind of cliche to say this but DAMN IS THIS MOVIE BEAUTIFUL.",True
