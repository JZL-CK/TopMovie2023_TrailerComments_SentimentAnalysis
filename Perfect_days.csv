Dalla descrizione letta però, mi sembra ci sia un precedente e sorprendentemente analogo film,  cambia solo il luogo geografico: America anziché Giappone. Non so se riuscirà anche solo ad avvicinarvisi e comunque sicuramente arriverà in ritardo...si tratta di PATERSON di Jim Jarmusch, con un Adam Driver in stato di grazia: poesia pura. Ho pianto dopo averlo visto.",True
@slamdunk2270,2023-12-28T11:03:45Z,7,"The film boldly sets the tone with its title, ""Perfect Days,"" paying homage to Lou Reed's song. This literal announcement initially lowered my expectations, fearing a contemplative stroll without any substance. The song ""Perfect Day"" almost too obviously underscores the film's philosophy and its character, Hirayama-san. Right from the beginning, the film confirmed this impression as the cinematography is meticulously aligned with the daily routine of the custodian portrayed. However, despite the playlist's lack of originality (""House of the Rising Sun"", ""Feeling Good""...), the film's magic eventually prevails. The production originates from a government initiative to promote Tokyo's ""artistic"" designed toilets to the world who couldn’t join the Olympics due to COVID-19. Wim Wenders uses that initial ambition to honor something else to be honored about Japan: its cleanliness culture and virtues. Virtue in patience. Virtue in environmental protection. Virtue in curiosity (whether literary or musical). Virtue in the server-served relationship (whether at the bar or in restrooms). Virtue in respect of a stranger’s intimacy (whether it’s at the public bath or anywhere for that matter). All carefully presented without any irony. Indeed, through Yakusho Koji's tender portrayal, Wim Wenders declares his very own profound and sincere love for Japan. 

There's a saying: ""Not all heroes wear capes"". And Hirayama-san falls in that category. Instead, he actually wears his public toilet uniform. Despite flaws, Wenders doesn't seek absolute redemption for Hirayama-san, presenting him as a hero with imperfections. Like Sam Raimi’s Spiderman or Martin Campbell’s Zorro, these heroes remain human, relatable figures. Hirayama-san has flaws, but the film refrains from being judgmental about his lifestyle. This discretion in the directing is particularly showcased in the absence of editing when, for instance, Hirayama-san ignores (or at least does not reply to) the bookseller's comments. A typical Japanese trait, that is introversion towards strangers, which could be perceived as negative to the western eye. Instead, we just follow along the old man's adventure (or lack of adventure) until he gets offered a choice: Continue living by stretching time, savoring ""perfect days"" in solitude... or embrace a romantic adventure, reunite with his family, and make new friendships like the ones that brings you to drink beers along the Sumida River... So far, Hirayama-san was choosing the former. It's a choice that belongs to each of us. Here it is perfectly encapsulated by the film's beauty and cruelty, echoing life's mantra: ""to choose is to die."" Hirayama-san is torn between the contentment of a simple, ego-free, solitary life and the potential for greater happiness once it is shared with other human beings, or even transmitted (as seen with the two young girls he encounters throughout the story). A conviction that grips Hirayama-san when he rejects the idea that a shadow is not darker when the bodies of two beings juxtapose, because, despite his solitary instinct, he has understood: we are MORE together. A striking and poignant night scene modestly shot by Wenders. A scene that echoes the contrast between the first half of the film and the second. In the first part, Hirayama-san encounters numerous people, such as this ""invisible"" man (as they are called in Japan, those homeless individuals who wander the streets, ignored by everyone). He looks at him with tenderness, before his perception eventually changes towards the end as he understands that it could be his fate in a few years…

This internal conflict reflects a profoundly human sentiment: melancholy, a blend of resignation, towards unfulfilled destinies, and poetic contemplation of our existence. The film captures this powerlessness against time that defines our lives. This conclusion culminates in that very last frontal-shot sequence where Hirayama-san, uncertain whether to smile or cry, hesitates with which route to take in his car. Who knows which one is the right choice? Because only one thing remains certain: the sun will rise tomorrow and the day after. And by acknowledging it, he can control whether his day is going to be a perfect day or not.

This film will leave an everlasting impression on me because it's intertwining Japan, my country of adoption, and an existential crisis about destiny which deeply resonates with my doubt about having children, fearing the loss of ""choice."" 

The film ends with a title screen displaying the definition of komorebi.

Komorebi, the art displayed throughout the picture, consists in the shimmering light and shadows through tree leaves. This title sequence concludes with a note: « It only exists in the moment. » 

Like our very own lifespan on Earth.",True
